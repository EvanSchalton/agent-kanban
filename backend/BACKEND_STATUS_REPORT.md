# Backend Status Report

## Date: 2025-08-19

## Summary

All reported backend issues have been investigated and resolved. The backend is functioning correctly with all CRUD operations persisting properly.

## Issues Investigated

### 1. Edit Operations Not Persisting

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** Edit operations ARE persisting correctly. The PUT endpoint at `/api/tickets/{ticket_id}` successfully updates tickets and commits changes to the database.

**Test Results:**

- Updated ticket title and description
- Changes persisted after refresh
- Database commits working properly

### 2. DELETE Endpoint Missing

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**Finding:** DELETE endpoint exists and is fully functional at `/api/tickets/{ticket_id}` (lines 313-339 in tickets.py)

**Implementation Details:**

- Properly handles cascade deletion of related comments and history
- Returns 404 for non-existent tickets
- Broadcasts deletion event via WebSocket

### 3. Move Operation Persistence

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Finding:** Move operations ARE persisting correctly. The POST endpoint at `/api/tickets/{ticket_id}/move` successfully updates column positions and persists to database.

**Test Results:**

- Moved tickets between columns
- Position changes persisted after refresh
- History tracking working correctly

## Comprehensive Test Results

All CRUD operations tested and verified:

1. **CREATE** - ✅ Working (201 status, ticket created)
2. **READ** - ✅ Working (200 status, data retrieved)
3. **UPDATE** - ✅ Working (200 status, changes persisted)
4. **MOVE** - ✅ Working (200 status, column changes persisted)
5. **DELETE** - ✅ Working (200 status, ticket removed)

## Database Commit Analysis

The backend uses SQLModel with explicit session commits in all endpoints:

- `session.commit()` called after all modifications
- `session.refresh()` ensures updated data is returned
- Transaction handling is proper

## WebSocket Integration

All operations properly broadcast events:

- ticket_created
- ticket_updated
- ticket_moved
- ticket_deleted

Both WebSocket and Socket.IO protocols are supported for real-time updates.

## Recommendations

1. **No backend fixes required** - All operations are working as designed
2. **Check frontend integration** - If issues persist, they may be on the frontend side:
   - Ensure frontend is properly handling API responses
   - Check if frontend is using correct API endpoints
   - Verify frontend state management after operations

## API Endpoints Reference

- GET `/api/tickets/` - List tickets with pagination
- GET `/api/tickets/{id}` - Get single ticket
- POST `/api/tickets/` - Create ticket
- PUT `/api/tickets/{id}` - Update ticket
- POST `/api/tickets/{id}/move` - Move ticket to different column
- DELETE `/api/tickets/{id}` - Delete ticket

## Conclusion

The backend is fully functional with no issues found. All reported problems appear to be either misunderstandings or potentially frontend-related issues. The backend properly handles all CRUD operations with appropriate database persistence.
