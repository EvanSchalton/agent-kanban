# CRITICAL DATA LOSS FIX REPORT

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: Cards were disappearing after refresh due to multiple database files and incorrect path configuration.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Multiple Database Files

- **Problem**: Two separate SQLite databases existed:
  - `/workspaces/agent-kanban/backend/agent_kanban.db` (2254 tickets - production data)
  - `/workspaces/agent-kanban/agent_kanban.db` (28 tickets - new database)
- **Impact**: Application was using the wrong database after path fixes, causing apparent data loss

### 2. Relative vs Absolute Path Issue

- **Problem**: Database path was relative, causing different databases to be created based on working directory
- **Impact**: Frontend and backend could access different databases

### 3. Testing Flag Misconfiguration

- **Problem**: `testing: bool = True` was hardcoded in production config
- **Impact**: Production environment was running with test settings

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Path Fix (`/backend/app/core/database.py`)

```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Use absolute path for database
PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent
DATABASE_PATH = PROJECT_ROOT / "agent_kanban.db"
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", f"sqlite:///{DATABASE_PATH.absolute()}")
```

### 2. Safe Database Initialization (`/backend/app/core/safe_database.py`)

- Created comprehensive safety module with:
  - Production database detection
  - Automatic backup creation
  - Prevention of accidental drops/recreates
  - Table existence checking before creation
  - Data integrity verification

### 3. Configuration Fix (`/backend/app/core/config.py`)

```python
testing: bool = False  # Changed from True
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging (`/backend/app/main.py`)

- Added critical startup logging
- Database operation tracking
- Table creation monitoring

### 5. Data Migration

- Successfully migrated 2254 tickets from backend database to root database
- Created backup before migration
- Removed duplicate database to prevent confusion

## Verification Results

âœ… **All data recovered and preserved**:

- 2254 tickets recovered
- 276 boards preserved
- 25 comments maintained
- Database now in correct location: `/workspaces/agent-kanban/agent_kanban.db`

## Prevention Measures

1. **Absolute Path Usage**: Database always uses absolute path from project root
2. **Safe Initialization**: Database tables only created if they don't exist
3. **Production Protection**: Safety checks prevent dangerous operations on production data
4. **Automatic Backups**: Backups created before any risky operations
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: All database operations are logged with warnings

## Testing Scripts Created

1. `test_database_persistence.py` - Tests data persistence across restarts
2. `migrate_database.py` - Safely migrates data between databases
3. `verify_fix.py` - Verifies the fix is working correctly

## Recommendations

1. **Remove old database file**: `/workspaces/agent-kanban/backend/agent_kanban.db.old` after confirming everything works
2. **Monitor logs**: Watch for any `ðŸ”´ CRITICAL` log entries during startup
3. **Regular backups**: The system now creates automatic backups in `/workspaces/agent-kanban/backups/`
4. **Environment variables**: Consider using `DATABASE_URL` env var for production deployments

## Status

âœ… **ISSUE RESOLVED** - All data recovered and system protected against future data loss
