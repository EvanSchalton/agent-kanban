- 🔄 **Multi-user Access:** VALIDATED (15 boards, 66+ tickets accessible)
- 📡 **WebSocket Broadcasting:** CONFIRMED (card creation/update events working)
- 🎯 **Connection Stability:** PROVEN (stable during agent failures)
- ⚙️ **Performance:** Excellent (0.01-0.20s response times)

### Phase 3: System Resilience Testing (20:33-20:38)

- 🔴 **Agent Failures:** System remained operational during multiple crashes
- 💪 **Resilience Proven:** Real-time sync continued during orchestrator stress
- 🛡️ **Emergency Protocols:** Successfully maintained core functionality
