# PM Final Status Report

**Time:** 03:00 UTC
**Session:** bugfix-fresh

## Git Staging Cleanup - COMPLETED

✅ Removed critical files from staging:

- 8 database/backup files
- 9+ PM/QA temporary reports
- PID files and system files

**Remaining:** 741 files (mix of staged/unstaged)

- Mostly documentation, tests, and config
- No critical database files staged
- Safe from accidental corruption

## Agent Status Summary

### Frontend-Recovery (Window 6)

- **Status:** Non-responsive to commands
- **Issue:** In bypass mode but not processing directives
- **Tasks Attempted:**
  1. TODO/FIXME cleanup (completed earlier)
  2. Console statement removal (not started)
  3. Git staging review (ignored)
- **Assessment:** Agent appears stuck in a state where it receives but doesn't process commands

### QA-Validator (Window 4)

- **Status:** Assigned to test suite fix
- **Task:** Fixing vitest configuration error
- **Priority:** HIGH - blocking all frontend tests

## System Health

✅ Backend API: Healthy
✅ Frontend: Running (5173)
✅ Database: Protected
❌ Test Suite: Broken (being fixed)

## Decisions Made

1. Direct PM intervention on git staging (agent unresponsive)
2. Removed critical files from staging area
3. QA validator working on test suite fix
4. Frontend-recovery agent needs investigation/restart

## Recommendations

1. Investigate why frontend-recovery agent is stuck
2. Consider restarting the bugfix-fresh session
3. Create proper .gitignore for prevented files
4. Establish commit strategy for remaining 700+ files

**Critical Issues Resolved:** Database corruption risk eliminated
