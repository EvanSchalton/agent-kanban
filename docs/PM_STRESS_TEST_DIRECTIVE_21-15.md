# PM Stress Test Directive - 21:15 UTC

## Elevated Testing Protocol Initiated

### Frontend Emergency Agent

**Mission: Critical Path Stress Testing**

- Rapid card creation (10 cards burst test)
- Concurrent drag operations (multi-tab)
- Board switching under load
- Session recovery testing
- **Priority: Data integrity under stress**

### Frontend Recovery Agent

**Mission: Performance Deep Analysis**

- 30-second usage profiling
- Memory leak detection
- Core Web Vitals measurement
  - Target LCP: < 2.5s
  - Target FCP: < 1.8s
- React re-render optimization
- **Priority: Performance bottleneck identification**

### Testing Escalation

Both agents assigned advanced testing protocols to ensure system stability under production-like conditions.

### Expected Outcomes

- Identification of any critical failure points
- Performance baseline establishment
- Memory leak detection
- Data loss prevention validation
