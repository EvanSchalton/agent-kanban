✅ **Performance Metrics:**

## Agent Assessment

The frontend-recovery agent is in **standby mode** with active monitoring:

- No frontend issues requiring recovery intervention
- Maintaining watchful presence for rapid response
- Background monitors continuously checking UI responsiveness

## PM Decision

**Action:** Maintain current standby status

**Rationale:**

1. Frontend is stable with excellent performance metrics
2. Agent is actively monitoring, not truly idle
3. Recovery capability should remain on standby for rapid response
4. Current configuration optimal for system stability

## Recommendations

1. Keep agent in standby for immediate response capability
2. Continue background monitoring activities
3. No reassignment needed at this time
4. Consider this "active standby" rather than idle

**Status:** Operating as intended - no intervention required.
