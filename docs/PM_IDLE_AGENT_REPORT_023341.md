**Time:** 02:34 UTC
**Session:** bugfix-fresh

✅ **Frontend:** Responsive (port 5173)

✅ **Database:** Protected and operational

## Agent Assessment

The QA validator is not idle but rather in active monitoring mode:

- Performing periodic health checks every 120 seconds
- Monitoring backend API, frontend, and database status
- Last activity confirmed at 02:25:40 UTC

## Decision

**No action required.** The agent is functioning as designed in a monitoring role. This is expected behavior for a QA validator during stable system operation.

## Recommendations

1. Continue monitoring for genuine idle states
2. Consider adjusting idle detection thresholds for monitoring agents
3. QA validator should remain in standby for rapid response to issues

**PM Decision:** Agent remains assigned to current monitoring duties.
