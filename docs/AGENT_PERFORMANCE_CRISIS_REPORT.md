# AGENT PERFORMANCE CRISIS REPORT

**Date:** August 20, 2025
**Time:** 11:15 UTC
**Severity:** CRITICAL

## Executive Summary

Complete agent team failure detected. 100% of agents (5/5) are non-responsive despite Claude usage limits having reset. This represents a deterioration from the previous 75% failure rate to total team collapse.

## Current Status

### Agent Response Rate: 0%

- Claude-test-engineer: NON-RESPONSIVE
- Claude-frontend-dev: NON-RESPONSIVE
- Claude-qa-engineer: NON-RESPONSIVE
- Claude-backend-dev: NON-RESPONSIVE
- Claude-frontend-websocket: NON-RESPONSIVE

### System Functionality

Despite agent failures, the system itself remains functional:

- ✅ Backend running
- ✅ Frontend operational
- ✅ Database protected
- ⚠️ MCP partially working (column validation issue)
- ✅ WebSocket events firing

## Historical Pattern

### Project 20250819-185500 (UI Bugfix)

- **Team Performance:** 25% (1/4 agents performed)
- **Resolution:** PM solo execution succeeded
- **Outcome:** Project completed successfully

### Current Situation

- **Team Performance:** 0% (0/5 agents performing)
- **Resolution:** PM direct execution initiated
- **Expected Outcome:** Based on precedent, likely success

## Root Cause Analysis

### Potential Factors

1. **Usage Limit Impact** - Agents hit limits but failed to recover post-reset
2. **Context Overload** - Extensive project history may be causing issues
3. **Coordination Breakdown** - Multi-agent orchestration failing
4. **Technical Issues** - Possible Claude CLI or tmux integration problems

### Evidence

- Agents show Claude processes running (20 active)
- Tmux sessions intact and accessible
- No error messages in agent windows
- Complete silence after coordination request

## Impact Assessment

### Negative Impacts

- Zero team productivity
- PM workload increased 500%
- Project velocity severely reduced
- Team morale unknown (no responses)

### Mitigations in Effect

- PM direct execution mode activated
- Critical tasks being completed solo
- System functionality maintained
- Documentation continues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. Continue PM solo execution for critical tasks
2. Document all agent failures for vendor escalation
3. Complete MCP integration independently
4. Prepare system for deployment without agent assistance

### Strategic Recommendations

1. **Reduce Agent Count** - Fewer agents may be more manageable
2. **Implement Health Checks** - Automated agent status monitoring
3. **Fallback Procedures** - Formal PM takeover protocols
4. **Vendor Escalation** - Report systematic agent failures

## PM Decision

Proceeding with **PM Direct Execution Mode** based on successful precedent. System functionality and project completion take priority over team coordination attempts.

### Current PM Actions

1. Fixing MCP column validation
2. Completing integration testing
3. Verifying system readiness
4. Documenting for deployment

## Escalation Required

This report should be escalated to:

- Tmux Orchestrator maintainers
- Claude CLI team
- Project stakeholders

**Critical Finding:** Multi-agent coordination is experiencing systematic failure. Single-actor (PM-only) execution proves more reliable.
