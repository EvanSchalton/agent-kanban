## 🧪 TEST METHODOLOGY

### Test Environment

- **Backend:** FastAPI + WebSocket on port 8000
- **Frontend:** React + Vite on port 5173
- **WebSocket Protocol:** `ws://localhost:8000/ws/connect`
- **Test Framework:** Node.js automated test suite
- **Simulation:** Two concurrent users (Alice & Bob) + board isolation (Charlie)

### Test Scenarios Executed

1. **User Attribution Setup** - Username connection and authentication
2. **Real-Time Ticket Creation** - Instant sync across clients
3. **Drag-Drop Operations** - Movement with attribution
4. **Ticket Updates** - Real-time editing sync
5. **Concurrent Operations** - Simultaneous actions handling
6. **Board Isolation** - Cross-board event filtering
7. **Data Cleanup** - Automated test artifact removal

---

## ✅ DETAILED TEST RESULTS

### Step 1: User Attribution Setup

```
✅ User connections established (Alice: true, Bob: true)
✅ User attribution in connection (Alice: Alice, Bob: Bob)
```

**Validation:** WebSocket handshake includes username parameter, connection confirmation shows correct user identity.

### Step 2: Real-Time Ticket Creation

```
✅ Ticket creation API call (Status: 201)
✅ Alice received ticket_created event
✅ Bob received ticket_created event
✅ Real-time sync working
```

**Validation:** API creates ticket, WebSocket broadcasts event to all connected clients instantly.

### Step 3: Drag-Drop with Attribution

```
✅ Ticket move API call (Status: 200)
✅ Alice received move event
✅ Bob received move event
✅ Move attribution correct (moved_by: Bob)
✅ Real-time drag-drop sync
```

**Validation:** Drag-drop operations sync instantly with proper user attribution showing "moved by Bob".

### Step 4: Ticket Updates

```
✅ Ticket update API call (Status: 200)
✅ Alice received update event
✅ Bob received update event
✅ Real-time update sync
```

**Validation:** Ticket modifications broadcast instantly to all connected users.

### Step 5: Concurrent Operations

```
✅ Concurrent ticket creation (Status codes: 201, 201)
✅ Alice received both creation events
✅ Bob received both creation events
✅ Concurrent operations handled correctly
```

**Validation:** System handles simultaneous actions from multiple users without conflicts.

### Step 6: Board Isolation

```
✅ Board 2 ticket creation
✅ Board isolation working (Board 2 events on Board 1: 0)
```

**Validation:** Events are properly filtered by board_id - users on different boards don't see each other's activities.

### Step 7: Cleanup

```
✅ Test data cleanup (Cleaned 5/5 tickets)
```

**Validation:** Automated cleanup successfully removes all test artifacts.
