# ✅ FINAL SYSTEM VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Date:** August 20, 2025 - 06:32 UTC
**QA Engineer:** bugfix-stable project
**Purpose:** Final production readiness validation for all 5 critical fixes

## 🎯 VALIDATION SCOPE

This checklist validates the following 5 critical system fixes:

1. **Board Isolation** - Each board shows only its own cards
2. **WebSocket Sync** - Real-time updates between browser windows
3. **User Attribution** - Proper user tracking and assignment
4. **MCP Tools Integration** - MCP server CRUD operations
5. **Card Creation** - Frontend card creation workflow

## 📋 VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### 1. BOARD ISOLATION ✅

**Requirement:** Each board must display only its own tickets, preventing data leakage

- [ ] **Test 1.1:** Multiple boards exist in database
- [ ] **Test 1.2:** Board 1 shows only board 1 tickets
- [ ] **Test 1.3:** Board 3 shows only board 3 tickets
- [ ] **Test 1.4:** WebSocket events are board-scoped
- [ ] **Test 1.5:** Cross-board contamination prevented

**Status:** 🔄 **TESTING IN PROGRESS**

---

### 2. WEBSOCKET SYNCHRONIZATION ✅

**Requirement:** Real-time updates must sync between multiple browser windows

- [ ] **Test 2.1:** WebSocket connection established
- [ ] **Test 2.2:** Card creation broadcasts to all clients
- [ ] **Test 2.3:** Card updates sync across browsers
- [ ] **Test 2.4:** Drag-drop movements sync in real-time
- [ ] **Test 2.5:** Comments appear instantly in other windows

**Status:** 🔄 **TESTING IN PROGRESS**

---

### 3. USER ATTRIBUTION ✅

**Requirement:** All actions must be properly attributed to users/agents

- [ ] **Test 3.1:** Created tickets show correct creator
- [ ] **Test 3.2:** Updated tickets track who made changes
- [ ] **Test 3.3:** Comments show proper author
- [ ] **Test 3.4:** History logs capture user attribution
- [ ] **Test 3.5:** MCP operations attribute to agents

**Status:** 🔄 **TESTING IN PROGRESS**

---

### 4. MCP TOOLS INTEGRATION ✅

**Requirement:** MCP server must provide full CRUD operations for external agents

- [ ] **Test 4.1:** MCP server running on stdio transport
- [ ] **Test 4.2:** create_task creates tickets correctly
- [ ] **Test 4.3:** get_task retrieves full ticket details
- [ ] **Test 4.4:** update_task_status moves tickets between columns
- [ ] **Test 4.5:** MCP operations trigger WebSocket events

**Status:** 🔄 **TESTING IN PROGRESS**

---

### 5. CARD CREATION WORKFLOW ✅

**Requirement:** Frontend must create cards successfully via UI

- [ ] **Test 5.1:** Add card modal opens correctly
- [ ] **Test 5.2:** Form submission creates ticket
- [ ] **Test 5.3:** Card appears in correct column
- [ ] **Test 5.4:** WebSocket broadcasts card creation
- [ ] **Test 5.5:** No "Method Not Allowed" errors

**Status:** 🔄 **TESTING IN PROGRESS**

---
