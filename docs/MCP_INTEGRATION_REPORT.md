# MCP Integration Test Report

## Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Priority:** P1
**Tested By:** Frontend Dev Team

---

## Executive Summary

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration with the Agent Kanban API has been thoroughly tested and validated. All critical functionalities are working correctly, including ticket CRUD operations and real-time WebSocket broadcasting.

---

## Test Configuration

### API Endpoint

- **Backend API:** `http://localhost:18000`
- **WebSocket:** `ws://localhost:18000/ws/connect`
- **MCP Server:** Located at `/backend/run_mcp.py`

### Fixed Issues

- ✅ Updated API_BASE from port 8000 to 18000 in `run_mcp.py`
- ✅ Verified all MCP tools are properly configured

---

## Test Results Summary

### 1. API Connectivity ✅

- MCP server can successfully connect to the backend API
- Health check endpoint responds correctly
- API is accessible on port 18000

### 2. Board Operations ✅

- **List Boards:** Successfully retrieved 9 boards
- **Get Board State:** Retrieved complete board state with tickets

### 3. Ticket CRUD Operations ✅

#### Create Ticket

- ✅ Successfully creates tickets via MCP-style payload
- ✅ Accepts all required fields (title, board_id, current_column)
- ✅ Handles optional fields (description, acceptance_criteria, priority)
- ✅ Returns created ticket with ID

#### Read/Get Ticket

- ✅ Retrieves full ticket details by ID
- ✅ Includes all ticket properties
- ✅ Returns proper JSON response

#### Update Ticket

- ✅ Updates ticket properties (title, description, priority)
- ✅ Tracks changes with `changed_by` field
- ✅ Returns updated ticket data

#### Delete Ticket

- ✅ Successfully deletes tickets
- ✅ Cleanup operations working

### 4. Ticket Management ✅

#### Move Ticket (Status Update)

- ✅ Moves tickets between columns
- ✅ Accepts column names: "Not Started", "In Progress", "Blocked", "Ready for QC", "Done"
- ✅ Tracks movement with `moved_by` field

#### Claim Task

- ✅ Assigns tickets to agents
- ✅ Updates assignee field correctly
- ✅ Prevents double-claiming

#### Add Comment

- ✅ Adds comments to tickets
- ✅ Includes author attribution
- ✅ Timestamps comments correctly

### 5. List/Filter Operations ✅

- ✅ Lists tasks with pagination support
- ✅ Filters by board_id working correctly
- ✅ Returns paginated response with metadata

### 6. WebSocket Integration ✅

All MCP operations correctly trigger WebSocket broadcasts:

- ✅ **ticket_created**: Broadcast when creating tickets
- ✅ **ticket_updated**: Broadcast when updating tickets
- ✅ **ticket_moved**: Broadcast when moving tickets
- ✅ **ticket_deleted**: Broadcast when deleting tickets

Real-time synchronization is working perfectly between MCP operations and frontend clients.

## Usage Example

### Running the MCP Server

```bash
cd /workspaces/agent-kanban/backend
python run_mcp.py
```

The server runs in stdio mode and can be integrated with any MCP-compatible client.

### Sample MCP Request (Create Ticket)

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "create_task",
  "params": {
    "title": "New Task from MCP",
    "board_id": 1,
    "description": "Created via MCP",
    "priority": "2.0",
    "created_by": "mcp_agent"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "id": 123,
    "title": "New Task from MCP",
    "board_id": 1,
    "current_column": "Not Started",
    "priority": "2.0"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```
