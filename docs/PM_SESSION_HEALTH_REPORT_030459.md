# PM Session Health Report & Recommendation

**Time:** 03:04 UTC
**Session:** bugfix-fresh

## Critical Findings

### Agent Status

1. **Frontend-recovery (Window 6):** STUCK
   - In bypass mode but completely unresponsive
   - Cannot process commands
   - Exit/interrupt signals ineffective

2. **QA-validator (Window 4):** STUCK
   - Also in bypass mode and unresponsive
   - Did not start assigned test fix task
   - Cannot be revived with commands

3. **Other Agents:** Unknown status
   - backend-api, frontend-emergency, frontend-ui-specialist
   - Not recently checked but likely similar state

### System Metrics

- 31 Claude processes running (high)
- Context at 3% (auto-compact warning)
- Services running but agents non-functional

## Root Cause Analysis

- Agents appear to have hit context limits
- "Auto-update failed" message suggests version issues
- Bypass mode preventing normal command processing
- Session has been running since Aug 22 (>24 hours)

## PM RECOMMENDATION

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Recommendation:** Graceful session termination and restart

### Rationale

1. Multiple agents stuck and unresponsive
2. Cannot complete assigned critical tasks
3. Git staging cleanup done (safe to restart)
4. Test suite fix blocked
5. Long-running session likely degraded

### Restart Procedure

1. Save current state/progress
2. Terminate bugfix-fresh session
3. Start fresh session with clear objectives
4. Reassign critical tasks:
   - Fix test suite configuration
   - Review remaining git staging
   - Complete console cleanup

### Protected Work

✅ Git staging cleaned of dangerous files
✅ System services still running
✅ No data loss risk

## DECISION

**PM Directive:** Recommend immediate session restart to restore agent functionality

**Status:** Session health critically degraded - restart needed
