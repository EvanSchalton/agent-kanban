# Tmux-Orchestrator Feedback v6: Monitor Auto-Submit Working

## Update on Previous Critical Bug

### Good News: Monitor Auto-Submit Feature Works

The idle monitor daemon successfully detects stuck messages and auto-submits them:

```log
2025-08-10 21:37:09,319 - INFO - Agent kanban-project:0 is idle with Claude interface
2025-08-10 21:37:09,319 - INFO - Auto-submitting stuck message for kanban-project:0 (attempt #1)
2025-08-10 21:37:09,325 - INFO - First auto-submit attempt for kanban-project:0
...
2025-08-10 21:37:39,310 - INFO - Agent kanban-project:0 is now active - resetting submission counter (was 1)
```

### What This Means

- The monitor correctly identifies when agents are stuck with Claude interface
- It automatically sends Enter to submit the message
- It tracks submission attempts and resets when agent becomes active
- This mitigates the C-Enter vs Enter issue mentioned in previous feedback

## Observed Behavior

### Spawning PM Agents

Using `mcp__tmux-orchestrator__spawn_agent` with agent_type "pm":

- Successfully creates session and window
- Names window "Claude-pm"
- Sends briefing message to Claude CLI
- Monitor detects and auto-submits stuck message within ~10 seconds
- Agent becomes active after auto-submission

### Agent Discovery

- Agents are discovered by the monitor
- Listed as session:window format (e.g., "kanban-project:0")
- Type detection shows as "PM" in list_agents output

## Positive Improvements Since v5

1. **Auto-Submit Working**: The monitor now actively fixes stuck messages
2. **Agent Spawning**: The spawn_agent MCP tool works reliably
3. **Monitoring Logs**: Clear, informative logging of all monitoring activities
4. **Recovery Detection**: Monitor properly detects when agents become active

## Remaining Considerations

### Window Naming

The PM spawns in window 0 with name "Claude-pm" which works but slightly differs from documentation that suggests "project:1" format. This doesn't affect functionality.

### Status Reporting

`get_agent_status` sometimes returns "unresponsive" even when agent is working. This may be a timing issue or require refinement of the health check logic.

## Recommendations for Users

1. **Always Start Monitor First**: Run `tmux-orc monitor start` before spawning agents
2. **Wait for Auto-Submit**: Give monitor ~10-30 seconds to detect and fix stuck messages
3. **Use MCP Tools**: The MCP spawn_agent tool is more reliable than manual spawning
4. **Check Monitor Logs**: Review `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/.tmux_orchestrator/logs/idle-monitor.log` for troubleshooting

## Summary

The tmux-orchestrator has significantly improved since v5 feedback. The critical message submission bug is now mitigated by the monitor's auto-submit feature. The system is functional for orchestrating agent teams, though some minor refinements in status reporting could enhance the user experience.
