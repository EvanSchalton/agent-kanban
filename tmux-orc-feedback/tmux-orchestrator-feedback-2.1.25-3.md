# TMUX Orchestrator Feedback Report 2.1.25-3

## Issue: Agent Recovery and Monitoring Discrepancies

**Date**: 2025-08-20 02:17:04 UTC
**Reporter**: Project Manager
**Severity**: HIGH - Operations Impact

### Problem Description

**Monitoring System Accuracy Issues:**

1. System reported bugfix:4 as "idle" when agent was actually in ERROR state
2. bugfix:4 became completely unresponsive during Playwright test execution
3. Required manual PM intervention to kill unresponsive agent

### Root Cause Analysis

**Agent State Detection Flaw:**

- Monitoring incorrectly classifies ERROR states as "idle"
- No distinction between legitimate standby vs. crashed agents
- False alerts causing unnecessary PM escalations

**Persistent Team Model Issues:**

- bugfix:4 crashed during: `npx playwright test comprehensive-qa-suite.spec.ts`
- Agent became unresponsive and could not be recovered
- Consistent pattern with previous persistent team failures

### Recovery Actions Taken

```bash
# Manual agent termination required
tmux kill-window -t bugfix:4
```

### Recommendations

**Immediate Fixes Needed:**

1. **Improve Agent State Detection**: Distinguish between idle, standby, and ERROR states
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Report actual agent status (responsive vs. unresponsive)
3. **Auto-Recovery**: Implement automatic termination of unresponsive agents

**Strategic Changes:**

1. **Abandon Persistent Teams**: Switch to on-demand agent spawning
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when agents crash during test execution
3. **PM Alert Accuracy**: Only escalate truly problematic situations

### Impact

- Required manual PM intervention during monitoring cycle
- Wasted resources on unresponsive agent
- False monitoring alerts reducing system trust

### Workaround

Manual agent management until monitoring accuracy improvements implemented.
