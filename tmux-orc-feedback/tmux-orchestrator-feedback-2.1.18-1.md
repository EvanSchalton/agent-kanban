# PM Stuck in Monitoring Report Response Loop

## Critical Issue: PM Responds to Monitoring with Single Period

### Problem Description

The PM agent enters an infinite loop responding to monitoring daemon notifications with just "." followed by an incrementing minute counter. This makes the PM completely unresponsive to actual management duties.

### Evidence

```
● [541+ minutes.]

> 🔔 MONITORING REPORT - 13:31:26 UTC
  ⚠️ IDLE AGENTS:
  - kanban-v2:1 (Claude-developer)
  - kanban-v2:2 (Claude-developer)
  - kanban-v2:3 (Claude-qa)
  - kanban-v2:4 (Claude-developer)

● [542+ minutes.]

> 🔔 MONITORING REPORT - 13:32:35 UTC
  [same idle agents...]

● [543+ minutes.]
```

The PM has been stuck for 540+ minutes (9+ hours) just responding with periods.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Monitoring reports overwhelming PM**: Constant idle notifications every 60 seconds
2. **PM loses context**: After many monitoring reports, PM enters minimal response mode
3. **Context depletion**: PM might be running low on context (shown "Context left until auto-compact: 8%")
4. **No loop breaking logic**: PM doesn't recognize it's stuck in a pattern

### Impact

- **Complete PM failure**: PM becomes useless for coordination
- **All agents idle**: Entire team stops working with no PM guidance
- **Project stalled**: No progress possible without functioning PM

### Suggested Fixes

#### 1. Daemon Improvements

- Add pattern detection for repeated minimal responses
- Reduce notification frequency if PM appears stuck
- Stop notifications if PM responds with single characters multiple times

#### 2. PM Context Improvements

- Add explicit instructions to ignore repetitive monitoring reports
- Implement response variety requirement
- Add "stuck detection" to PM context

#### 3. Recovery Mechanism

- Auto-restart PM if stuck in loop for > 5 responses
- Send "BREAK" command to interrupt loops
- Clear message queue periodically

### Workaround

Manual intervention required:

1. Send explicit "STOP" message to PM
2. Restart PM if unresponsive
3. Consider stopping daemon temporarily

### Severity

**CRITICAL** - Makes orchestration system completely non-functional
