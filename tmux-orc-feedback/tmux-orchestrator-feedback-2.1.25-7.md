# TMUX Orchestrator Feedback - Version 2.1.25-7

## Issue: Complete PM Session Crash During Active Bug Fixing

**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Version:** 2.1.25
**Severity:** CRITICAL - System Failure

### Problem Description

The entire bugfix session (bugfix:1 with 5 windows) crashed completely while PM was actively coordinating bug fixes. All agents and work lost.

### Context Leading to Crash

- PM was successfully managing team with QA Engineer, Frontend Developer, Test Engineer
- Active bug fixing in progress (board isolation resolved, Playwright fixed)
- PM was responding to new "resource not found" card creation bug
- Then complete session disappearance

### Impact

- Complete loss of all active work
- All spawned agents terminated
- Bug fixing progress halted
- User experiencing blocking issues with no active team

### Observed Behavior

- Session completely vanished from `tmux-orc session list`
- No session recovery possible
- Pubsub daemon still running but no targets available
- No error messages or crash logs visible

### Expected Behavior

- Sessions should remain stable during active work
- If crashes occur, should provide error information
- Recovery mechanisms should be available

### Root Cause Analysis

Unknown - need investigation into:

1. Memory issues with multiple Claude agents
2. Session management stability
3. Potential resource conflicts
4. Agent interaction causing crashes

### Immediate Impact

- User left with blocking bugs and no active support team
- Need to restart entire PM and team spawning process
- Loss of context and progress from previous session

### Recommended Investigation

1. Add session monitoring/logging
2. Implement crash detection and automatic restart
3. Add session state persistence
4. Improve error reporting for crashes

### Recovery Action

Will spawn new PM immediately to continue bug fixing work.

**Status:** Critical System Failure
**Recovery:** New PM spawn required immediately
