## Critical Issue: Agent Crashes Not Detected

### Problem Description

Agents are crashing silently without detection by the orchestrator daemon. This is causing critical development delays.

### Observed Behavior

1. Developer agent at kanban-project:2 crashed twice today
2. No error messages or notifications from orchestrator
3. Manual restart required each time
4. Work blocked until manual intervention

### Impact

- Development work stopped unexpectedly
- Frontend team blocked waiting for backend auth
- Manual monitoring required (inefficient)

### Current Workaround

Created `/workspaces/agent-kanban/monitor-agents.sh` script that:

- Checks agent health by looking for Claude prompt
- Lists dead agents
- Can restart dead agents with --restart flag

### Requested Features

1. **Automatic crash detection** - Monitor agent health every 30 seconds
2. **Auto-restart capability** - Restart crashed agents automatically
3. **Crash notifications** - Alert PM when agent crashes
4. **Health endpoint** - API to check agent status
5. **Crash logs** - Capture last output before crash

### Reproduction Steps

1. Spawn agent with tmux-orchestrator
2. Agent crashes after ~30-60 minutes of work
3. Orchestrator doesn't detect or report crash
4. Manual intervention required

### Temporary Solution

Running monitor script every 5 minutes via cron:

```bash
*/5 * * * * /workspaces/agent-kanban/monitor-agents.sh --restart >> /tmp/agent-monitor.log 2>&1
```

### Priority

CRITICAL - Blocking development progress
