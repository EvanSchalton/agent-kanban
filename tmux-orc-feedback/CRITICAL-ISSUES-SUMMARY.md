# Critical Issues Found in tmux-orchestrator v2.1.18

## System Shutdown Required - Awaiting Updates

### Why We Shut Down

The orchestration system has fundamental flaws that make it unusable for productive work. The PM becomes stuck in a response loop, causing complete team paralysis.

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. PM Context Collapse from Monitoring Spam

- **Issue**: Daemon sends identical monitoring reports every 60 seconds
- **Result**: PM's context gets polluted, enters minimal response mode (".")
- **Impact**: PM stuck for 540+ minutes just responding with periods
- **Files**: `tmux-orchestrator-feedback-2.1.18-1.md`, `tmux-orchestrator-feedback-2.1.18-2.md`

### 2. No Escalation or Recovery Logic

- **Issue**: Daemon doesn't detect stuck PMs or escalate warnings
- **Result**: Teams sit idle indefinitely with no intervention
- **Impact**: Complete project failure without manual intervention
- **File**: `tmux-orchestrator-feedback-2.1.18-3.md`

### 3. Message Delivery Issues

- **Issue**: MCP tool may not properly submit messages to agents
- **Workaround**: Must use `tmux-orc agent send` CLI command
- **Impact**: Agents appear unresponsive when they're actually not receiving complete messages

## Recommended Fixes (Provided to Maintainers)

### Immediate (v2.1.19)

1. **3-Strike Escalation System**
   - 3 min: Gentle reminder
   - 6 min: Urgent warning with instructions
   - 10 min: Kill PM and let daemon recover

2. **Response Quality Detection**
   - Detect minimal responses (".", "ok", "[X+ minutes]")
   - Accelerate to termination if PM not actually working

3. **Message Content Improvement**
   - Progressive escalation with actionable guidance
   - Include example commands
   - Remind PM of their role and responsibilities

### Future (v2.2.0)

1. **Backoff Strategy** - Reduce notification frequency over time
2. **Task Suggestions** - Provide contextual suggestions based on project state
3. **Performance Metrics** - Track PM effectiveness over time

## Current Status

- ✅ All feedback documented and saved
- ✅ Three detailed feedback files created
- ✅ Team shut down cleanly
- ✅ Daemon stopped
- ⏳ Awaiting tmux-orchestrator updates

## Next Steps

1. Wait for tmux-orchestrator v2.1.19 or later
2. Test new escalation system when available
3. Verify PM recovery works properly
4. Resume Agent Kanban Board project with improved orchestration
