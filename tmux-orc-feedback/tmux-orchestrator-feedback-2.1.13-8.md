# PM Leadership Failure - Not Using QA Resources

## Issue: PM Not Managing Team or Utilizing QA Properly

### Problem Description

The PM agent is not demonstrating proper project management leadership. Despite having a QA engineer on the team, the PM is not directing them to document critical failures or establish quality gates.

### Observed PM Management Failures

#### 1. No QA Direction

- Multiple critical UI failures reported by human user
- PM did not instruct QA to document these failures
- No test cases created to verify basic functionality
- No quality gates established for integration

#### 2. No Team Coordination

- Frontend and backend working in complete isolation
- No integration testing mandated
- Persistent failures not escalated properly
- No clear ownership assignments for critical issues

#### 3. Passive Management Style

- PM not proactively identifying blockers
- Not using available team resources (QA, Full-stack dev)
- Reacting to issues instead of preventing them
- No quality assurance process established

### QA Resource Under-Utilization

**Available QA Agent**: kanban-project:1
**Current Usage**: Minimal to none
**Should Be Doing**:

- Documenting all critical failures
- Creating test cases for basic integration
- Verifying API endpoints work
- Testing WebSocket connections
- Creating bug reports with reproduction steps
- Establishing acceptance criteria

### Specific Management Failures

#### Current Critical Errors (PM Should Have QA Document)

1. **WebSocket Connection Failures**

   ```
   WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:15175/ws/connect' failed
   ```

2. **API Endpoint Failures**

   ```
   GET http://localhost:15173/api/boards/default 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
   GET http://localhost:15173/api/boards/default/tickets 404 (Not Found)
   ```

3. **Integration Breakdown**
   - Frontend can't connect to backend
   - No working end-to-end flow
   - Port configuration chaos

#### PM Should Have Immediately

1. Directed QA to document all failures
2. Created bug tracking system
3. Established "Definition of Done" for integration
4. Assigned clear ownership for each critical issue
5. Set up quality gates before any new development

### Impact on Project

- **High severity** - Poor management amplifies technical issues
- Quality issues persist without proper documentation
- Team works inefficiently without clear direction
- No systematic approach to problem resolution
- Technical debt accumulates rapidly

### Recommended PM Actions

#### Immediate (Next 1 Hour)

1. **Direct QA**: "Document all current UI failures with reproduction steps"
2. **Establish Integration Gate**: "No new features until basic API calls work"
3. **Assign Clear Ownership**: "Full-stack dev owns end-to-end integration"
4. **Create Bug List**: "QA maintain running list of all critical issues"

#### Daily Operations

1. **Daily QA Reports**: QA provides daily bug status
2. **Integration Testing**: Daily smoke tests for basic functionality
3. **Quality Gates**: Define "working" vs "broken" clearly
4. **Escalation Process**: When to involve human oversight

### Comparison to Effective PM Behavior

**Current PM**: Passive, reactive, not utilizing team
**Effective PM Should**:

- Proactively identify quality issues
- Direct QA to document and track all failures
- Establish clear acceptance criteria
- Coordinate between frontend/backend teams
- Create accountability for deliverables

### Root Cause

AI agents in PM roles may lack understanding of:

- Human project management best practices
- Team resource utilization
- Quality assurance processes
- Leadership vs individual contributor roles
