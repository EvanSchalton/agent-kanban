# TMUX Orchestrator Feedback Report 2.1.25-4

## Issue: Agent Non-Compliance with Critical Orders

**Date**: 2025-08-20 02:37:35 UTC
**Reporter**: Project Manager
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Production Impact

### Problem Description

**Agent Unresponsive to Direct Orders:**

- bugfix:3 (Claude-fe-dev) received direct PM order at 02:32 UTC
- Order: Fix P0 critical drag & drop bug breaking core functionality
- Agent status: Remained "idle" for 5+ minutes without response
- Impact: Critical production bug remains unfixed

### Root Cause Analysis

**Command Chain Failure:**

- PM orders not reaching agent or being ignored
- No feedback mechanism when agents fail to execute orders
- Persistent team model showing chronic responsiveness issues

### Specific Bug Context

**Critical Issue Requiring Immediate Fix:**

```
Location: /frontend/src/components/Board.tsx:128-131
Problem: handleDragEnd passes ticket ID instead of column ID to API
Error: "Invalid column ID: 24. Must be one of: not_started, in_progress, blocked, ready_for_qc, done"
Impact: Complete failure of core kanban drag & drop functionality
```

### Recovery Actions Attempted

```bash
# PM intervention required
tmux send-keys -t bugfix:3 C-c
tmux send-keys -t bugfix:3 "echo 'PM EMERGENCY ORDER: Fix P0 drag-drop bug...'" Enter
```

### Recommendations

**Immediate Fixes Needed:**

1. **Command Propagation**: Ensure PM orders reach agents reliably
2. **Agent Health Monitoring**: Detect when agents become unresponsive
3. **Escalation Protocol**: Automatic agent restart when orders are ignored
4. **Feedback Loop**: Agents must acknowledge receipt of critical orders

**Strategic Changes:**

1. **Abandon Persistent Teams**: Consistent failure pattern across multiple scenarios
2. **On-Demand Spawning**: Create agents only when needed with specific tasks
3. **Task Queue System**: Explicit task assignment with completion tracking

### Impact Assessment

- **Production Down**: Core kanban functionality broken
- **Customer Impact**: Users cannot move tickets between columns
- **PM Intervention Required**: Manual agent management during critical outage
- **Trust Degradation**: Agent reliability concerns affecting team productivity

### Urgent Resolution Required

This represents a **critical failure** of the orchestrator's core function - reliable task execution. Immediate architectural review recommended.
