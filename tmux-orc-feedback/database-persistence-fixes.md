# Database Persistence Fixes - Agent Kanban

## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. SQLite Foreign Key Constraints Disabled

**Problem:** Foreign key constraints were not enforced in SQLite, allowing orphaned records.
**Solution:** Added SQLite PRAGMA statements to enable foreign keys on connection.

### 2. Session Management Issues

**Problem:** Sessions were not properly managing transaction lifecycle.
**Solution:**

- Modified `get_session()` to ensure commits happen automatically
- Added proper exception handling with rollback
- Disabled autoflush to prevent premature writes
- Set `expire_on_commit=False` to maintain object state after commits

### 3. SQLite Configuration Sub-optimal

**Problem:** Default SQLite settings not optimized for concurrent access.
**Solution:**

- Enabled WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better concurrency
- Set synchronous mode to NORMAL for balance between safety and speed
- Added connection health checks with `pool_pre_ping=True`

### 4. Multiple Database Files

**Observation:** Found three separate database files:

- `/workspaces/agent-kanban/backend/agent_kanban.db` (2.7MB - main)
- `/workspaces/agent-kanban/frontend/agent_kanban.db` (880KB - old)
- `/workspaces/agent-kanban/agent_kanban.db` (32KB - old)

The backend correctly uses the first one, but having multiple DB files could cause confusion.

## Changes Made to `/workspaces/agent-kanban/backend/app/core/database.py`

```python
# Key changes:
1. Import `event` from sqlalchemy (not sqlmodel)
2. Added SQLite-specific connection args with isolation_level=None
3. Added event listener to set SQLite PRAGMAs on connect:
   - PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON
   - PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL
   - PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL
4. Modified get_session() to:
   - Use autoflush=False
   - Use expire_on_commit=False
   - Ensure commit happens in try/finally block
   - Add proper rollback on exception
```

## Test Results

Created comprehensive test script (`test_persistence_fix.py`) that verifies:

- ✅ Ticket creation persists
- ✅ Updates persist across sessions
- ✅ Comments persist with proper foreign keys
- ✅ Foreign key constraints are enforced
- ✅ Transactions properly commit/rollback

All tests passed successfully after the fixes.

## Recommendations

1. Consider migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production for better concurrent write performance
2. Clean up old database files to avoid confusion
3. Add monitoring for transaction commit failures
4. Consider implementing connection pooling configuration
