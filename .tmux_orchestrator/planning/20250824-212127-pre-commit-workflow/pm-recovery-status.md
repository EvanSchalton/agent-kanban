# PM Recovery Status Report
Generated: 2025-08-24 21:30 UTC

## Recovery Context
- PM recovered after failure detection
- Session: fullclean
- Recovery attempt: 1/3
- Status: SUCCESSFUL

## Team Status
| Agent | Window | Role | Status | Task Assignment |
|-------|---------|------|--------|-----------------|
| Developer | fullclean:2 | Senior Python Dev | Active | Phase 1: Creating tasks.py |
| QA Engineer | fullclean:3 | QA Engineer | Active | Preparing test scenarios |
| DevOps Engineer | fullclean:4 | DevOps Engineer | Active | Phase 2 prep: pre-commit config |
| Project Manager | fullclean:5 | PM (Self) | Active | Coordinating team |

## Project Status: Pre-Commit Workflow Implementation

### Current Phase
- **Phase 1: Tasks Infrastructure** (In Progress)
- Lead: Senior Python Developer (fullclean:2)
- Creating /workspaces/agent-kanban/tasks.py with invoke tasks

### Upcoming Phases
1. Phase 2: Pre-Commit Configuration (DevOps lead)
2. Phase 3: CI/CD Integration (DevOps with Python Dev)
3. Phase 4: Integration & Validation (QA lead with full team)

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ Verified all agents present and responsive
2. ✅ Checked monitoring daemon status (active)
3. ✅ Assigned specific tasks to each agent
4. ✅ Aligned team with project objectives

### Next Steps
1. Monitor Phase 1 progress (tasks.py creation)
2. Coordinate Phase 2 handoff when ready
3. Track quality gates and checkpoints
4. Ensure documentation is updated

## Risk Assessment
- **Session Mismatch**: Team plan specifies "precommit" session but agents are in "fullclean"
  - Mitigation: Working with current session, will adjust if needed
- **Recovery Impact**: Minimal - all agents responsive and tasks assigned

## Communication Protocol
- Regular status checks every 10 minutes
- Immediate escalation of blockers
- Using tmux-orc broadcast for team-wide updates

## Quality Gates Status
- [ ] Checkpoint 1: Tasks.py Working
- [ ] Checkpoint 2: Pre-Commit Functional
- [ ] Checkpoint 3: CI/CD Operational
- [ ] Checkpoint 4: Full Integration
