# Frontend Integration Fixes - Actually Fix The Issues
## Agent Kanban Board - Previous Fixes Did Not Work

**Date:** 2025-08-18
**Project Status:** Issues Still Present Despite "Fixes"
**Mission:** Actually fix the issues in the running application, not just test APIs

## Critical Reality Check

The previous team claimed fixes but **ALL issues are still present**:
1. ❌ Still showing "in about 4 hours" for new items
2. ❌ AC still not saving/displaying
3. ❌ Column movements still failing
4. ❌ Drag-drop still only works at right edge

## What Went Wrong

Previous teams:
- Fixed backend code but didn't verify in the actual UI
- Tested APIs directly but not the frontend integration
- Made timezone changes that didn't affect frontend display
- Claimed AC works but it doesn't in the actual app

## Real Issues to Fix

### 1. Frontend Timezone Display
**The Problem:** Frontend is displaying the wrong timezone calculation
```javascript
// Frontend is probably doing:
moment.utc(timestamp).fromNow() // Wrong! Shows future time

// Should be:
moment(timestamp).fromNow() // Parse with local timezone
```

### 2. AC Field Not Showing/Saving
**The Problem:** Frontend field name mismatch or not included in updates
```javascript
// Check what frontend is actually sending
// Is it acceptanceCriteria, acceptance_criteria, or ac?
// Is it included in the update payload?
// Is it displayed in the UI after save?
```

### 3. Column Movement WebSocket Issues
**The Problem:** Frontend incorrectly detecting connection state
```javascript
// Frontend checking wrong variable or WebSocket not properly connected
if (!wsConnected) { // This might be wrong
  showRetryMessage();
}
```

### 4. Drag-Drop CSS Issue
**The Problem:** Drop zone CSS too narrow
```css
/* Need to find and fix the actual CSS */
.droppable-area {
  width: 100%; /* Not just right edge */
}
```

## Required Approach

### DO NOT just test APIs - Fix the actual UI!

1. **Open the actual app in browser**
2. **Create a ticket and see "in 4 hours"**
3. **Fix the frontend code that displays this**
4. **Test in the browser that it shows correctly**
5. **Repeat for each issue**

## Verification Steps

### For EACH issue:
1. Reproduce the issue in the browser
2. Find the exact frontend code causing it
3. Fix the frontend code
4. Test in the browser it's fixed
5. Verify it stays fixed after refresh

### Timezone Fix Verification
```javascript
// In browser console after creating ticket:
document.querySelector('.ticket-time').innerText
// Should show "just now" not "in 4 hours"
```

### AC Field Verification
```javascript
// After saving AC:
1. Check network tab - is AC in the payload?
2. Check response - does AC come back?
3. Check UI - does AC display?
4. Refresh page - is AC still there?
```

### Movement Verification
```javascript
// Try to move a card
1. Check console for errors
2. Check network tab for failed requests
3. Check WebSocket connection status
4. Verify no false "reconnect" messages
```

### Drag-Drop Verification
```javascript
// Try dropping in middle of column
1. Should highlight when hovering anywhere
2. Should accept drop anywhere in column
3. Not just at the right edge
```

## Team Requirements

### Frontend Developer (LEAD)
- Must test everything in the actual browser
- Fix the actual React components
- Not just backend API calls

### Full-Stack Developer
- Ensure frontend-backend integration works
- Debug the actual data flow
- Fix both ends if needed

### QA Engineer
- Test in the actual browser
- Not just API testing
- Verify user experience

## Success Criteria

### MUST see in the browser:
- ✅ New tickets show "just now" not "in 4 hours"
- ✅ AC field visible and saves properly
- ✅ Cards move without "reconnect" errors
- ✅ Can drop cards anywhere in column

### NOT just API tests - actual UI must work!
