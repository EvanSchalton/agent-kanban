# MCP Integration Testing - Team Plan
## Agent Kanban Board MCP Validation

**Planning Directory**: `/workspaces/agent-kanban/.tmux_orchestrator/planning/20250818-194630-mcp-integration-testing/`

## Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: The MCP server must be added to Claude before executing this plan:
```bash
claude mcp add <appropriate-mcp-configuration>
```

## Project Context

The Agent Kanban Board is 100% complete and functional. This mission focuses on:
1. Validating MCP integration works correctly
2. Testing all 9 MCP tools through agent interaction
3. Demonstrating full kanban workflow via MCP commands

## Team Composition

### Minimal Team (MCP Testing Focus)
1. **QA Engineer** - Primary MCP tester
   - **Role**: Execute comprehensive MCP tool testing
   - **Focus**: Validate all 9 MCP tools work correctly
   - **Authority**: Create test data, perform operations, verify results

2. **Project Manager** - Coordination only
   - **Role**: Monitor test execution, track results
   - **Constraint**: NO technical work, only coordination
   - **Focus**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage

### NO Additional Agents Needed
- Backend Dev not needed (application already complete)
- Frontend Dev not needed (UI already working)
- Focus is purely on MCP tool validation

## Task Assignments

### QA Engineer - MCP Testing Protocol

#### Phase 1: Basic Tool Validation
1. **list_columns** - Verify board structure
2. **get_board_state** - Check initial board state
3. **list_tasks** - List existing tickets (if any)

#### Phase 2: CRUD Operations
4. **create_task** - Create 5 test tickets with varying priorities
   - "MCP Test Task 1" - High priority
   - "MCP Test Task 2" - Medium priority
   - "MCP Test Task 3" - Low priority
   - "MCP Test Task 4" - Urgent
   - "MCP Test Task 5" - Normal

5. **get_task** - Retrieve each created ticket and verify details

6. **edit_task** - Update properties on test tickets
   - Change descriptions
   - Modify priorities
   - Update assignees

#### Phase 3: Workflow Operations
7. **claim_task** - Assign tickets to different mock agents
   - Agent-Alpha claims task 1
   - Agent-Beta claims task 2
   - Agent-Gamma claims task 3

8. **update_task_status** - Move tickets through workflow
   - Move task 1: Not Started → In Progress
   - Move task 2: Not Started → In Progress → Review
   - Move task 3: Not Started → In Progress → Review → Done

9. **add_comment** - Add comments to track progress
   - Add progress notes to each ticket
   - Include timestamps and agent attribution

#### Phase 4: Advanced Testing
10. **Bulk Operations**
    - Create 10 additional tickets rapidly
    - Test filtering with list_tasks
    - Verify board state with many tickets

11. **Error Handling**
    - Try invalid ticket IDs
    - Test missing required fields
    - Attempt invalid status transitions

12. **Performance**
    - Measure response times for each operation
    - Test concurrent operations

### Project Manager Tasks

1. **Setup Verification**
   - Confirm MCP server is accessible
   - Verify all 9 tools are available
   - Check backend server is running

2. **Test Monitoring**
   - Track QA progress through phases
   - Document any tool failures
   - Note performance metrics

3. **Report Creation**
   - Compile test results
   - Document any issues found
   - Create final validation report

## Success Metrics

### Tool Coverage
- ✅ All 9 MCP tools tested
- ✅ Each tool used at least 3 times
- ✅ Both success and error cases validated

### Functional Validation
- ✅ Complete ticket lifecycle demonstrated
- ✅ Multi-agent workflow simulated
- ✅ Board state consistency verified

### Performance Metrics
- ✅ All operations complete within 2 seconds
- ✅ No timeouts or connection failures
- ✅ Concurrent operations handled correctly

## Test Data Cleanup

After testing:
1. Document all created test tickets
2. Optionally clean up test data
3. Leave some tickets as demonstration

## Deliverables

1. **Test Execution Log**
   - Timestamp of each operation
   - Tool used and parameters
   - Result (success/failure)
   - Response time

2. **Validation Report**
   - Summary of test results
   - Any bugs or issues found
   - Performance analysis
   - Recommendations

3. **Demo Script**
   - Step-by-step MCP usage guide
   - Example commands for each tool
   - Common workflow patterns

## Execution Instructions

### For the PM
1. Verify MCP server is added to Claude
2. Spawn QA Engineer with MCP access
3. Monitor test execution
4. Document results in planning directory
5. Create project closeout when complete

### For QA Engineer
1. Use ONLY MCP tools (no direct API calls)
2. Follow the 4-phase testing protocol
3. Document each operation's result
4. Report any failures immediately
5. Measure and record response times

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **MCP Connection Issues**: Verify server is running before starting
- **Tool Failures**: Document thoroughly for debugging
- **Data Conflicts**: Use unique test data names

### Operational Risks
- **Incomplete Testing**: Follow all 4 phases systematically
- **Missing Documentation**: Record results in real-time
- **Performance Issues**: Note any slow operations

## Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 45-60 minutes
- Phase 1: 10 minutes (basic validation)
- Phase 2: 15 minutes (CRUD operations)
- Phase 3: 15 minutes (workflow testing)
- Phase 4: 15 minutes (advanced testing)

## Important Notes

1. **MCP-Only Testing**: This plan assumes MCP tools are the ONLY interface used
2. **No Code Changes**: Application is complete, this is validation only
3. **Documentation Focus**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
4. **Real-World Simulation**: Test patterns that agents would actually use

*Team plan prepared for MCP integration validation of the completed Agent Kanban Board*
