# üö® P1 BUG REPORT: Board Deletion Failure

**Date:** 2025-08-20
**Time:** 03:15 UTC
**QA Engineer:** Claude (bugfix:2)
**Priority:** P1 - High
**Component:** Board Management - DELETE endpoint

## üìä BUG SUMMARY

**ISSUE:** Board deletion fails with "Data integrity constraint violation"
**ENDPOINT:** `DELETE /api/boards/{id}`
**ERROR CODE:** HTTP 400 - INTEGRITY_ERROR
**STATUS:** ACTIVE - Blocking board management functionality

## üîç TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Error Response:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Data integrity constraint violation",
    "code": "INTEGRITY_ERROR",
    "error_id": "err_1755659733667",
    "timestamp": 1755659733
  }
}
```

### Reproduction Steps:
1. Navigate to application with multiple boards
2. Attempt to delete any board via UI or API
3. Send DELETE request to `/api/boards/{id}`
4. Observe 400 error with integrity constraint violation

### Backend Implementation Analysis:

**File:** `backend/app/api/endpoints/boards.py:168-201`

**Delete Logic:**
```python
@router.delete("/{board_id}")
async def delete_board(board_id: int, session: Session = Depends(get_session)):
    # 1. Get board
    # 2. Delete tickets and their dependencies (comments, history)
    # 3. Delete board
    # 4. Commit transaction
```

**Cascade Deletion Order:**
1. Comments (for each ticket)
2. Ticket History (for each ticket)
3. Tickets (for the board)
4. Board itself

## üö® ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**LIKELY CAUSES:**

1. **Missing Foreign Key Dependencies:** Database may have constraints not handled in deletion logic
2. **Transaction Isolation:** Multiple operations in single transaction may be failing
3. **Orphaned References:** Some table may still reference the board after ticket deletion
4. **Database Lock:** Concurrent operations preventing deletion

## üß™ TEST CASES PERFORMED

### Test Case 1: Delete Empty Board
**Command:** `curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:18000/api/boards/9"`
**Expected:** Success (200)
**Actual:** ‚ùå HTTP 400 - Integrity constraint violation
**Board 9 Status:** 1 ticket (not empty as expected)

### Test Case 2: API Endpoint Verification
**Endpoint Exists:** ‚úÖ YES - Found in boards.py:168
**Implementation:** ‚úÖ YES - Proper cascade deletion logic
**Database Schema:** ‚ùì UNKNOWN - Need to verify foreign key constraints

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### For Frontend Developer (bugfix:3):
1. **Browser Testing:** Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. **Network Tab:** Capture full HTTP request/response for deletion attempts
3. **UI Behavior:** Document what user sees when deletion fails

### For Backend Investigation:
1. **Database Schema:** Verify foreign key constraints in all tables
2. **Error Logging:** Check backend logs for detailed constraint violation info
3. **Transaction Rollback:** May need to modify deletion logic

## üìã REPRODUCTION SCRIPT

```bash
# Test board deletion failure
curl -v -X DELETE "http://localhost:18000/api/boards/9"

# Expected: 400 Bad Request with integrity constraint violation
# Should return: Success with board deletion confirmation
```

## üèÜ SEVERITY ASSESSMENT

**P1 Priority Confirmed:**
- Blocks critical board management functionality
- Affects user workflow (cannot clean up test/demo boards)
- Simple reproduction steps
- Clear error message indicates backend issue
