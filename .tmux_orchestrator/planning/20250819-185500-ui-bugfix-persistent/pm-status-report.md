Successfully recovered from PM failure and resumed project coordination.

## Current Team Status
- **Session:** `bugfix` (Persistent - DO NOT CLOSE)
- **Team Size:** 4 active agents
- **Mission:** Fix UI bugs iteratively with continuous QA testing

### Team Composition ‚úÖ
1. **PM (bugfix:1)** - Project coordination and team management
2. **QA Engineer (bugfix:2)** - Proactive testing and bug discovery
3. **Frontend Developer (bugfix:3)** - Bug fixes and development
4. **Test Engineer (bugfix:4)** - Automated testing and regression prevention

## üî• Critical Issues in Progress

### P0 - Drag & Drop Bug (ACTIVE FIX)
- **Status:** Frontend Developer actively investigating
- **Issue:** Board.tsx:118:29 passing draggableId instead of column ID
- **Expected Fix:** Correct column ID mapping for API calls
- **Assigned To:** Frontend Developer (bugfix:3)
- **Monitoring:** QA Engineer monitoring fix progress

### P2 - WebSocket Stability (QUEUED)
- **Status:** Identified in QA report, pending P0 resolution
- **Issue:** Intermittent connection drops, "No pong received in 35 seconds"
- **Priority:** Address after P0 fix complete

## Team Coordination Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Actions
- PM recovery and team assessment complete
- All required team members spawned and briefed
- Critical P0 bug identified and assigned
- QA Engineer tasked with systematic testing
- Test Engineer tasked with automated test creation

### üîÑ In Progress
- Frontend Developer: Investigating and fixing drag & drop bug
- QA Engineer: Starting systematic testing of application
- Test Engineer: Creating automated tests for drag & drop functionality

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Verification of drag & drop fix
- WebSocket stability investigation
- Comprehensive testing of remaining features

## Testing Coverage Plan

### Immediate (Post P0 Fix)
- [ ] Verify drag & drop functionality works correctly
- [ ] Test all column transitions
- [ ] Ensure no regression in existing features
- [ ] Monitor WebSocket connection stability

### Systematic Testing Queue
- [ ] Board CRUD operations
- [ ] Card CRUD operations
- [ ] Modal interactions
- [ ] Navigation flows
- [ ] Form validations
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Loading states

## Communication Protocol ‚úÖ
- All team members briefed on persistent session nature
- QA reports bugs directly to PM for prioritization
- PM coordinates fixes and verification
- Team remains on standby between issues

## Quality Gates
- Zero tolerance for regressions
- All fixes must pass QA verification
- TypeScript compliance required
- Console errors must be resolved

## Next Steps (5-minute window)
1. Monitor frontend developer progress on P0 fix
2. Ensure QA engineer begins testing verification
3. Coordinate test engineer automated test creation
4. Prepare for P2 WebSocket investigation after P0 resolution

## Session Management
- **CRITICAL:** Session must remain persistent per team plan
- DO NOT close session or kill agents
- Team stays on standby for continuous bug fixing
- Wait for explicit user instruction to disband
