# Team Plan: Pre-Commit Workflow Execution

## Mission
Execute systematic pre-commit workflow to fix all issues and commit/push 757+ files with quality assurance.

## Team Composition

### Project Manager
- Coordinate the workflow execution
- Track progress through phases
- Ensure quality gates are met
- Create final commit and push

### Senior Developer
- **Session**: fullclean:2
- Fix configuration issues in pyproject.toml
- Handle manual code fixes (line length, unused variables)
- Ensure code quality standards

### DevOps Engineer
- **Session**: fullclean:4
- Run automated fixes (format, lint)
- Execute pre-commit validations
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline after push

### QA Engineer
- **Session**: fullclean:3
- Validate manual fixes after Developer completes them
- Final quality assurance before commit
- Document any remaining issues

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Configuration Updates (10 min)
**Lead: Senior Developer**
- Update root pyproject.toml - move deprecated settings to `lint` section
- Update backend/pyproject.toml similarly
- Verify configuration is valid

### Phase 2: Automated Fixes (10 min)
**Lead: DevOps Engineer**
```bash
# Run formatting
invoke format

# Run linting with fixes
invoke lint --fix

# Check what was fixed
git diff --stat
```

### Phase 3: Manual Fixes (15 min)
**Lead: Senior Developer**
- Fix line length in backend/app/api/endpoints/bulk.py:260 and :301
- Remove unused `result` variable in backend/app/api/endpoints/health.py:107
- Review any other issues flagged

### Phase 4: Validation (10 min)
**Lead: DevOps Engineer**
```bash
# Run pre-commit until clean
pre-commit run --all-files

# Verify all hooks pass
invoke check
```

### Phase 5: Commit & Push (10 min)
**Lead: PM with team**
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Create comprehensive commit
git commit -m "feat: Implement pre-commit workflow and comprehensive cleanup

- Add tasks.py with invoke commands for development workflow
- Add .pre-commit-config.yaml with multi-language support
- Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD and version bumping
- Clean up root directory (reduced from 89+ to <20 files)
- Remove memorial/celebration text files
- Organize test files into proper directories
- Fix all linting and formatting issues
- Update deprecated configuration settings
- All pre-commit hooks passing

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Phase 6: Verification (5 min)
**Lead: DevOps Engineer**
- Monitor GitHub Actions for CI/CD success
- Wait for version bump (if configured)
- Pull any auto-commits

## Quality Gates

1. **Pre-commit Clean**: `pre-commit run --all-files` shows all passing
2. **No Regressions**: Existing functionality preserved
3. **Clean Commit**: All 757+ files properly committed
4. **CI/CD Success**: GitHub Actions workflows pass
5. **Version Bump**: Automatic version increment (if applicable)

## Risk Mitigation
- Create backup branch before major changes
- Test invoke commands before bulk operations
- Review large diffs before committing
- Monitor CI/CD closely after push
