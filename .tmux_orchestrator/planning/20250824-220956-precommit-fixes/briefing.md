# Pre-Commit Workflow Execution Briefing

## Current State
- **757 files** staged for commit (major changes including cleanup and pre-commit infrastructure)
- Pre-commit checks failing with formatting and linting issues
- Ruff format modified 75 files
- Line length violations detected (E501)

6. Monitor for automatic version bump

## Issues to Fix

### Phase 1: Configuration Updates

- Remove unused variable in backend/app/api/endpoints/health.py
- Review any remaining issues

### Phase 4: Validation & Commit

- Stage all changes
- Create comprehensive commit message
- Push to origin/main

## Success Criteria
- All pre-commit hooks pass
- Clean git commit with all 757+ files
- Successful push to GitHub
- CI/CD pipeline passes
- Version bump received (if configured)
