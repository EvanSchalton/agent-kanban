## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Rapid Assessment (10 min)

- Categorize by type and purpose
- Mark for: Keep/Move/Delete
- Create move plan

### Phase 2: Directory Setup (5 min)
- Create `tests/qa/`, `tests/debug/`, `tests/monitoring/`, `tests/validation/`, `tests/performance/`
- Create `scripts/` if needed for utility scripts
- Create `archive/` for old reports if needed

### Phase 3: Mass Migration (15 min)
**Parallel execution by file type:**
- Senior Dev: Move all test-*.js, *.html files
- DevOps: Move all *.py, *.sh files
- QA: Validate each move

### Phase 4: Report Cleanup (10 min)
- Review all *_REPORT.md, *_STATUS.md files
- Archive important ones
- Delete redundant ones
- Clean up PM_*, QA_* files

### Phase 5: Final Sweep (10 min)
- Remove demo files
- Remove one-off scripts
- Final validation
- Git staging

## Aggressive Cleanup Rules
1. **When in doubt, move to tests/** - Better organized than cluttered
2. **Delete obviously temporary files** - Old demos, test outputs
3. **Archive reports older than 2 days** - Unless marked critical
4. **No sentimentality** - If it's not actively used, it goes

## Success Metrics
- Root directory files: < 20 (from 89+)
- All tests in tests/
- Clean professional structure
- No functionality broken
- Git properly tracking all changes

## Communication
- Use fullclean session
- Quick decisions - don't overthink
- Focus on speed and thoroughness
- Report blockers immediately
