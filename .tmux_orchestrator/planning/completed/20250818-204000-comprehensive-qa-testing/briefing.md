# Comprehensive QA Testing & Functionality Fixes Briefing
## Agent Kanban Board - Critical Missing Features and Persistence Issues

**Date:** 2025-08-18
**Project Status:** Multiple Core Features Not Working
**Mission:** Comprehensive QA testing with Playwright and fix all critical functionality gaps

## Critical Issues Identified by User

### 1. Edit Persistence Failure ❌
**Issue:** Editing cards (e.g., changing Acceptance Criteria) shows in history but doesn't persist on the card itself
**Impact:** Data loss, user frustration, unusable for real work
**Expected:** Edits should save to database and display on cards

### 2. No Delete Functionality ❌
**Issue:** No option to delete cards
**Impact:** Cards accumulate forever, no cleanup possible
**Expected:** Delete button/option on each card

### 3. Move Persistence Failure ❌
**Issue:** Moving cards to new columns doesn't persist after page refresh
**Impact:** Board state unreliable, work lost
**Expected:** Card positions should save to database

### 4. Unknown Additional Issues ❓
**Need:** Comprehensive testing to find other broken features

## Root Cause Analysis

These issues suggest fundamental problems:
1. **Frontend-Backend Sync Issues** - Changes not being saved properly
2. **Database Persistence Problems** - Data not committing or being overwritten
3. **Missing CRUD Operations** - Delete functionality never implemented
4. **State Management Issues** - Frontend state not syncing with backend

## Comprehensive Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Playwright Test Suite Setup
Create automated tests for all core functionality:

#### Card CRUD Operations
- Create new card
- Edit card title
- Edit card description
- Edit acceptance criteria
- Delete card (when implemented)
- Verify persistence after refresh

#### Board Operations
- Move card between columns
- Move multiple cards
- Reorder cards within column
- Verify positions persist

#### Data Persistence
- Edit → Refresh → Verify
- Move → Refresh → Verify
- Create → Refresh → Verify
- Delete → Refresh → Verify

#### Real-time Updates
- Multi-user scenarios
- WebSocket sync verification
- Concurrent edit handling

### Phase 2: Manual QA Testing
While Playwright tests run, manually verify:
- All UI interactions
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance under load

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Critical User Journeys
1. **Create Card Flow**
   - Click "Add Card"
   - Fill all fields
   - Save
   - Verify card appears
   - Refresh page
   - Verify card persists

2. **Edit Card Flow**
   - Click card to edit
   - Change title/description/AC
   - Save changes
   - Verify updates display
   - Refresh page
   - Verify changes persist

3. **Move Card Flow**
   - Drag card to new column
   - Drop card
   - Verify position
   - Refresh page
   - Verify position persists

4. **Delete Card Flow**
   - Select card
   - Click delete option
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify card removed
   - Refresh page
   - Verify deletion persists

## Expected Findings

### Likely Backend Issues
- Missing or broken PUT/PATCH endpoints
- Transaction commit problems
- Incorrect SQL updates
- Missing DELETE endpoint

### Likely Frontend Issues
- Optimistic updates without backend confirmation
- State not syncing after API calls
- Missing error handling for failed saves
- UI components not re-rendering

### Database Issues
- Missing foreign key constraints
- Incorrect column mappings
- Transaction rollback issues

## Fix Priority Order

### Priority 1: Data Loss Prevention
1. Fix edit persistence
2. Fix move persistence
3. Ensure all changes save to database

### Priority 2: Core Functionality
1. Implement delete functionality
2. Fix any CRUD operations
3. Ensure data consistency

### Priority 3: User Experience
1. Add loading states
2. Add success confirmations
3. Improve error messages

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All edits persist after refresh
- ✅ Card moves persist after refresh
- ✅ Delete functionality works
- ✅ No data loss scenarios
- ✅ All CRUD operations functional

### Test Requirements
- ✅ Playwright test suite covers all features
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Manual QA finds no critical issues
- ✅ Multi-user scenarios work

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ Operations complete in <1 second
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Handles 100+ cards smoothly

## Team Requirements

### QA Engineer
- Write comprehensive Playwright tests
- Execute manual testing
- Document all issues found
- Verify fixes work

### Backend Developer
- Fix persistence issues
- Implement DELETE endpoint
- Fix database transactions
- Ensure API reliability

### Frontend Developer
- Fix state management
- Implement delete UI
- Ensure proper API integration
- Fix optimistic updates

## Deliverables

1. **Playwright Test Suite**
   - Comprehensive coverage
   - Automated regression tests
   - CI/CD ready

2. **Bug Report**
   - All issues documented
   - Severity ratings
   - Reproduction steps

3. **Fixed Application**
   - All critical issues resolved
   - Tests passing
   - Ready for production

## Timeline Estimate

- Test Suite Development: 45 minutes
- Testing Execution: 30 minutes
- Bug Fixing: 60-90 minutes
- Verification: 30 minutes

Total: 3-4 hours

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK** - Application is fundamentally broken for production use:
- Data loss issues make it unusable
- Missing delete is a showstopper
- Persistence failures break user trust
