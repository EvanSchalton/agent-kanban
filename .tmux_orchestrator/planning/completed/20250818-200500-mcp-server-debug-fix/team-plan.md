# Team Plan: MCP Server Debug and Fix
## Mission: Diagnose and fix MCP server startup failure, then execute integration testing

### Project Manager Configuration
```yaml
name: mcp-fix-pm
session: mcp-debug:1
goal: Debug and fix MCP server startup issues for Agent Kanban Board, then complete integration testing
```

## Team Composition

### 1. Backend Developer (bd)
**Role:** Debug and fix MCP server implementation
```yaml
name: backend-dev
expertise: Python, FastAPI, MCP Protocol, FastMCP
responsibilities:
  - Review MCP server implementation at /workspaces/agent-kanban/backend/app/mcp/server.py
  - Check Python imports and dependencies
  - Debug FastAPI integration with MCP
  - Fix any code issues preventing startup
  - Validate MCP tool definitions
tools: code editor, python debugger, pip
```

### 2. DevOps Engineer (devops)
**Role:** Environment setup and configuration management
```yaml
name: devops-engineer
expertise: System configuration, Docker, Environment setup, CLI tools
responsibilities:
  - Check Python environment and PYTHONPATH
  - Verify all dependencies installed correctly
  - Test uvicorn server startup independently
  - Debug Claude CLI configuration
  - Check for port conflicts
  - Review system logs for errors
tools: bash, system monitoring, configuration files
```

### 3. QA Engineer (qa)
**Role:** Testing and validation
```yaml
name: qa-engineer
expertise: Testing, API validation, Integration testing
responsibilities:
  - Test backend server independently
  - Validate each MCP tool once server is running
  - Execute comprehensive integration test plan
  - Document test results and any issues
  - Verify end-to-end MCP functionality
tools: API testing, MCP client, test automation
```

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Diagnosis (30 minutes)
**Lead:** DevOps Engineer
1. DevOps checks if backend server runs independently
2. Backend Dev reviews MCP server code for obvious issues
3. DevOps verifies all dependencies installed
4. Team shares findings in group discussion

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (20 minutes)
**Lead:** Backend Developer
1. Analyze error messages and stack traces
2. Identify specific failure point
3. Determine if issue is code, config, or environment
4. Document root cause clearly

### Phase 3: Fix Implementation (45 minutes)
**Lead:** Backend Developer
1. Backend Dev implements necessary code fixes
2. DevOps updates configuration if needed
3. QA creates test cases for the fix
4. Team validates fix works locally

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (60 minutes)
**Lead:** QA Engineer
1. Start MCP server successfully
2. Test all 9 MCP tools individually
3. Execute full ticket lifecycle test
4. Run bulk operations test
5. Test error handling scenarios

### Phase 5: Documentation (15 minutes)
**Lead:** Backend Developer
1. Update README with any missing steps
2. Add troubleshooting section
3. Document configuration requirements
4. Create final report

## Success Metrics
- [ ] MCP server starts without errors
- [ ] All 9 MCP tools accessible via Claude
- [ ] Backend API remains functional
- [ ] Integration tests pass successfully
- [ ] Documentation updated with findings

## Communication Protocol
- Use session `mcp-debug:1` for all team coordination
- Prefix messages with agent role (BD:, DO:, QA:)
- Share error messages and logs immediately
- Regular status updates every 15 minutes

## Contingency Plans

### If Dependencies Missing
- DevOps to create proper requirements.txt
- Install missing packages globally
- Update virtual environment if needed

### If Code Has Bugs
- Backend Dev to fix incrementally
- Test each fix before proceeding
- Create unit tests for problematic areas

### If Configuration Issues
- Try both Claude CLI and manual config methods
- Test with minimal configuration first
- Document working configuration exactly

## Resource Allocation
- Backend Developer: 60% effort (primary debugger)
- DevOps Engineer: 25% effort (environment support)
- QA Engineer: 15% initially, 60% during testing phase

## Timeline
- Total estimated time: 3 hours
- Checkpoint 1: Server starts (1 hour)
- Checkpoint 2: MCP tools work (2 hours)
- Checkpoint 3: Full testing complete (3 hours)

## Handoff Criteria
Project complete when:
1. MCP server runs reliably
2. All tools tested successfully
3. Documentation updated
4. Integration test report delivered
5. Ready for production use
