## Agent Kanban Board Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-18
**PM:** project:1
**Project Directory:** /workspaces/agent-kanban/.tmux_orchestrator/planning/20250815-044621-agent-kanban/

## Team Status

### Active Agents
1. **Project Manager** (project:1) - Active, coordinating team
2. **Backend Developer** (project:2) - Active, ready for tasks
3. **Frontend Developer** (project:3) - Active, restarted after initial error
4. **QA Engineer** (project:4) - Active, ready for testing tasks

### Monitoring
- Daemon Status: âœ… Running (PID: 37523)
- All agents being monitored for idle detection
- Recovery system active

## Project Assessment

### Current Progress
- **Backend:** Significant progress made
  - 104 tests collected and passing warnings only (deprecated Pydantic v1 validators)
  - FastAPI structure in place at `/workspaces/agent-kanban/backend/`
  - Database models, API endpoints, and services implemented
  - MCP server implementation exists
  - WebSocket and SocketIO services available

- **Frontend:** Initial structure created
  - React/TypeScript project initialized at `/workspaces/agent-kanban/frontend/`
  - Node modules installed
  - Basic directory structure in place
  - Test configuration issue detected (vitest config needs fixing)

### Identified Issues
1. Frontend test runner configuration error with vitest
2. Pydantic deprecation warnings in backend (v1 style validators need migration to v2)
3. Frontend directory structure appears non-standard (backend/frontend dirs inside src/)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Backend Developer: Review and fix Pydantic deprecation warnings
2. Frontend Developer: Fix vitest configuration and reorganize directory structure
3. QA Engineer: Assess test coverage and create comprehensive test plan
4. All: Review task list and identify completed vs remaining tasks

### Phase Focus
Based on task list review, we appear to be between Phase 2-3:
- Phase 2 (Backend Core) appears mostly complete
- Phase 3 (Frontend Development) needs significant work
- Phase 4 (Advanced Features) pending
- Phase 5 (Quality & Testing) partially complete for backend

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Backend foundation solid
- **Medium Risk:** Frontend needs structural fixes
- **Medium Risk:** Integration testing not yet validated

## Communication Plan
- Regular check-ins every 10 minutes
- Task assignments based on phases in team-plan.md
- Cross-team coordination for API contracts
- Immediate escalation of blockers
