# PM Status Update - 07:32 UTC
## Agent Kanban Completion Session - Continuation

### Current Status: IN PROGRESS - CRITICAL PHASE

**Test Pass Rate:** 83/104 (79.8%) - UNCHANGED from session start
**Target:** 100% completion
**Estimated Remaining:** 2-3 hours with focused execution

### Team Status

#### ACTIVE AGENTS
- **completion:2** (backend-dev) - ASSIGNED: History endpoints (9 tests)
- **completion:3** (frontend-dev) - ASSIGNED: Vitest configuration fix
- **completion:4** (qa-monitor) - ASSIGNED: Progress monitoring

#### CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
1. **History Endpoints (9 tests)** - Still ALL FAILING
   - Tests expect mocked data but getting real database results
   - Pagination returning 4 records instead of expected 150
   - Status codes correct (200) but data mismatched
   - Need to fix test setup vs actual implementation

2. **Frontend Vitest** - Status unknown, monitoring idle agent

### IMMEDIATE PM ACTIONS REQUIRED

#### Phase 1: History Endpoint Resolution (Next 30 minutes)
- Backend-dev needs specific guidance on test vs implementation mismatch
- Focus on either: fixing mocks to match reality OR fixing implementation to match tests
- Target: Convert 9 failures to passes = 88.4% pass rate

#### Phase 2: Statistics Endpoints (Following 30 minutes)
- 6 failing tests in enhanced_statistics.py (422 validation errors)
- Target: Additional 6 passes = 94.2% pass rate

#### Phase 3: Final Issues (Final hour)
- Frontend vitest resolution
- Remaining misc test failures
- Target: 100% completion

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM
- No progress visible in first 30 minutes
- Agent coordination may need improvement
- Clear technical path exists but execution needs focus

### Next Steps (Next 10 minutes)
1. Direct backend-dev with specific History endpoint strategy
2. Check frontend-dev progress on vitest
3. Ensure QA-monitor is tracking progress
4. Re-evaluate team effectiveness
