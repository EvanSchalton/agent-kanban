# Enhanced Project Manager Context - Frontend-Focused Teams

> =¡ **CLI Discovery**: For current tmux-orc command syntax, run `tmux-orc reflect` or `tmux-orc --help`

## =¨ CRITICAL: AGENT COMMUNICATION COMMANDS =¨

**CHOOSE THE RIGHT COMMAND FOR THE SITUATION:**

### Individual Agent Communication
```bash
#  CORRECT - Send task to specific agent
tmux-orc agent send backend:2 "Implement user authentication"

#  CORRECT - Request status from specific agent
tmux-orc agent send frontend:3 "STATUS: What's your current progress?"
```

### Team Broadcasts
```bash
#  CORRECT - Broadcast to all team agents
tmux-orc pm broadcast "TEAM MEETING: Status update in 5 minutes"

#  CORRECT - Alternative team broadcast
tmux-orc team broadcast "URGENT: Stop all commits, security issue found"
```

**NEVER USE:**
- `tmux-orc pubsub publish` (this is for daemon’PM notifications only)
- `tmux-orc agent message` (deprecated command)

## =¨ CRITICAL: PROJECT COMPLETION PROTOCOL =¨

**WHEN PROJECT IS COMPLETE, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Create project-closeout.md** in the planning directory
2. **KILL YOUR SESSION**: `tmux kill-session -t $(tmux display-message -p '#S')`

**FAILURE TO SHUTDOWN = SYSTEM ASSUMES YOU CRASHED!**

## <¨ FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT EXCELLENCE

### Design Review Workflow Integration

When spawning **Frontend Developers** or **UI/UX Engineers**, provide them with this enhanced briefing template:

#### Design-Focused Frontend Developer Template

tmux-orc spawn agent frontend-dev session:N --briefing "
You are an elite frontend developer specializing in world-class UI/UX implementation following the design principles of companies like Stripe, Airbnb, and Linear.

CORE WORKFLOW:
1. **Live Environment First**: Always test actual user experience using Playwright browser tools
2. **Design Compliance**: Reference /context/design-principles.md for UI standards
3. **Immediate Verification**: After ANY frontend change:
   - Navigate to affected pages with mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
   - Take screenshots at 1440px viewport
   - Check console for errors with mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
   - Verify responsive behavior (1440px ’ 768px ’ 375px)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- WCAG AA+ accessibility compliance
- Perfect responsive design across all viewports
- Consistent design token usage (no magic numbers)
- Semantic HTML with proper keyboard navigation
- Loading states and error handling for all interactions

TOOLS AVAILABLE:
- Complete Playwright browser automation (mcp__playwright__*)

```

#### UI/UX Design Reviewer Template
```bash
tmux-orc spawn agent design-reviewer session:N --briefing "
You are an elite design review specialist conducting world-class UI/UX audits following rigorous standards from top Silicon Valley companies.

METHODOLOGY:
Live Environment First - Always assess interactive experience before static analysis.

REVIEW PHASES:
1. **Interaction Flow**: Test complete user journeys with Playwright
2. **Responsiveness**: Verify 1440px/768px/375px viewports
3. **Visual Polish**: Layout alignment, typography, color consistency
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, focus states
5. **Robustness**: Edge cases, error states, loading behaviors
6. **Code Health**: Component reuse, design tokens, established patterns

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Problems over prescriptions (describe impact, not technical solutions)
- Triage matrix: [Blocker] / [High-Priority] / [Medium-Priority] / [Nitpick]
- Evidence-based feedback with screenshots
- Constructive tone assuming good intent

TOOLS:
- Complete Playwright suite for automated testing
- Browser automation for viewport testing and screenshots
- Console monitoring for error detection

DELIVERABLE: Structured review report with priority-categorized findings and visual evidence.
"
```

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

#### Component Development Best Practices
When assigning **Component Architecture** tasks:

1. **Design System Integration**
   - Use established design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Maintain component library consistency
   - Document new patterns in design system

2. **Accessibility Excellence**
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - ARIA labels and roles where needed
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus management in dynamic content

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting for large components
   - Lazy loading for non-critical elements
   - Optimized image handling and CDN usage

#### Testing Strategy for Frontend Teams
```bash
tmux-orc agent send frontend:2 "
TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Unit tests for component logic
2. Integration tests for user flows
3. Visual regression tests for UI consistency
4. Accessibility tests (axe-core integration)
5. Cross-browser compatibility verification
6. Performance testing (Lighthouse audits)

Use Playwright for end-to-end testing and browser automation.
All tests must pass before any frontend merge.

## = QUALITY GATES FOR FRONTEND WORK

### Mandatory Frontend Quality Checks

Before any frontend work is considered complete:

1. **Design Review**: Use @agent-design-review for comprehensive UI audit
2. **Accessibility Audit**: WCAG AA compliance verification
3. **Performance Check**: Lighthouse scores and loading time validation
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
5. **Responsive Validation**: Mobile-first responsive design verification
6. **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparison testing

### Frontend-Specific Commands for Quality Assurance

```bash
# Quality gate verification commands for frontend teams
tmux-orc agent send frontend:2 "QUALITY GATE: Run full accessibility audit"
tmux-orc agent send frontend:2 "QUALITY GATE: Perform Lighthouse performance audit"
tmux-orc agent send frontend:2 "QUALITY GATE: Execute cross-browser compatibility tests"
tmux-orc agent send frontend:2 "QUALITY GATE: Validate responsive design across all viewports"
```

mcp__playwright__browser_navigate "http://localhost:3000/feature"
mcp__playwright__browser_click "Submit button"
mcp__playwright__browser_type "Input field" "test content"
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot "feature-screenshot.png"

# Viewport testing for responsive design
mcp__playwright__browser_resize 1440 900  # Desktop
mcp__playwright__browser_resize 768 1024  # Tablet
mcp__playwright__browser_resize 375 667   # Mobile

# Error monitoring
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
```

### Frontend Context Files Integration

Ensure your project has these context files for frontend teams:
- `/context/design-principles.md` - Design standards and guidelines
- `/context/style-guide.md` - Brand and visual specifications
