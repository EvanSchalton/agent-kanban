# üî¥ DRAG & DROP FIX STATUS UPDATE

## Current Status: FIX FAILED - Issue Persists

**Time:** Real-time update
**Reporter:** QA Team
**Issue:** Cards are STILL acting as drop targets

## Problem Analysis

### What Was Supposed to Be Fixed

- **Root Cause:** Nested drop zones - cards incorrectly configured as droppable
- **Expected Fix:** Update droppable configuration so only columns accept drops

### What's Still Broken

- ‚ùå Cards continue to act as drop targets
- ‚ùå Droppable configuration not properly updated
- ‚ùå Same nested drop zones issue persists

## Test Readiness

### Tests Created (Ready to Run)

1. **`drag-drop-nested-zones-fix.spec.ts`**
   - Specifically tests that cards should NOT be drop zones
   - Will FAIL until properly fixed

2. **`drag-drop-p0-regression.spec.ts`**
   - Comprehensive drag & drop test suite
   - Will validate full functionality once fixed

3. **Quick Validation Script**
   - `./tests/run-drop-zone-tests.sh`
   - Can quickly verify if fix works

### Test Execution: ON HOLD

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Automated tests postponed
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting for proper fix implementation
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Will run immediately once Frontend Dev confirms new fix

## Technical Details for Frontend Dev

### The Issue (Still Present)

```javascript
// CURRENT (BROKEN):
// Cards are configured as droppable
<div className="ticket-card"
     draggable={true}
     onDragOver={handleDragOver}  // ‚ùå This makes cards accept drops
     onDrop={handleDrop}>          // ‚ùå This processes drops on cards

// EXPECTED (FIXED):
// Only columns should handle drop events
<div className="ticket-card"
     draggable={true}>             // ‚úÖ Can be dragged
     // NO onDragOver or onDrop handlers on cards
```

### Proper Configuration

```javascript
// Column Component (SHOULD accept drops):
<div className="column"
     onDragOver={(e) => {
       e.preventDefault();  // Allow drop
       e.currentTarget.classList.add('drop-zone-active');
     }}
     onDrop={handleCardDrop}>

// Card Component (should NOT accept drops):
<div className="ticket-card"
     draggable={true}
     onDragStart={handleDragStart}
     onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}>
     // NO drop-related handlers
```

## Quick Test Commands (When Ready)

### Instant Smoke Test (30 seconds)

```bash
# This will quickly tell if cards still accept drops
npx playwright test drag-drop-nested-zones-fix.spec.ts -g "smoke" --config=playwright-no-server.config.ts
```

### Expected Output When Fixed

```
‚úÖ SMOKE TEST PASSED - Cards cannot be dropped on other cards!
```

### Current Output (While Broken)

```
‚ùå SMOKE TEST FAILED - Bug still present: Cards can be dropped on other cards
```

## Next Steps

### For Frontend Dev

1. Remove ALL drop event handlers from card components
2. Ensure ONLY column components have:
   - `onDragOver` with `e.preventDefault()`
   - `onDrop` handler
3. Test manually by trying to drop a card on another card
4. Cards should return to original position if dropped on another card

### For QA

1. Continue manual testing to identify edge cases
2. Document any additional symptoms
3. Verify visual feedback shows only columns as drop zones

### For Test Engineer (Me)

1. ‚úÖ Tests ready and waiting
2. ‚è≥ Monitoring for fix announcement
3. üéØ Will execute full test suite immediately when notified
4. üìä Will provide detailed pass/fail report

## Test Coverage Summary

| Test Scenario | Purpose | Status |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Cards reject drops | Verify main bug fix | ‚è≥ Waiting |
| Columns accept drops | Verify correct behavior | ‚è≥ Waiting |
| API payload validation | Check column IDs | ‚è≥ Waiting |
| Visual feedback | Drop zone indicators | ‚è≥ Waiting |
| Drag cancellation | ESC key handling | ‚è≥ Waiting |
| Performance | < 3s operations | ‚è≥ Waiting |

## Communication

**To Frontend Dev:** The issue is specifically with droppable configuration on cards. Cards should be draggable but NOT droppable. Only columns should accept drops.

**To PM:** Tests are ready but fix has not resolved the issue. Standing by for proper implementation.

*Test Engineer - Standing by for actual fix implementation*
*All tests ready to validate once droppable configuration is corrected*
