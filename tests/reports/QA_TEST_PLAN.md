# Agent Kanban Board - Comprehensive QA Test Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Agent Kanban Board application. The system consists of a FastAPI backend with MCP tools integration, a React frontend with drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time WebSocket communication.

## Test Environment

- **Backend API**: <http://localhost:18000>
- **Frontend UI**: <http://localhost:15173>
- **Database**: SQLite (agent_kanban.db)
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:18000/ws

## Testing Scope

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Backend Unit Tests

- [ ] Models validation (Board, Ticket, Comment, TicketHistory)
- [ ] Database operations (CRUD for all entities)
- [ ] Service layer logic (history_service, websocket_manager)
- [ ] API endpoint validation
- [ ] MCP tool functions

#### Frontend Unit Tests

- [ ] Component rendering (Board, Column, TicketCard, TicketDetail)
- [ ] Hook functionality (useWebSocket)
- [ ] Utility functions (statistics calculations)
- [ ] Context providers (BoardContext)

### 2. Integration Testing

#### API Integration Tests

- [ ] Board CRUD operations
  - Create board with custom columns
  - Update board configuration
  - Delete board with cascade
- [ ] Ticket operations
  - Create ticket with all fields
  - Update ticket properties
  - Move ticket between columns
  - Bulk ticket operations
- [ ] Comment management
  - Add comments with attribution
  - Retrieve comment history
  - Update/delete comments
- [ ] History tracking
  - Verify state changes are logged
  - Check timestamp accuracy
  - Validate duration calculations

#### MCP Tools Integration Tests

- [ ] `list_tasks` - Various filter combinations
- [ ] `get_task` - Valid and invalid IDs
- [ ] `create_task` - All field combinations
- [ ] `edit_task` - Partial updates
- [ ] `claim_task` - Assignment logic
- [ ] `update_task_status` - Column transitions

- [ ] `get_board_state` - Complete state retrieval

### 3. End-to-End Testing

#### Critical User Flows

1. **Task Creation Flow**
   - PM creates task via MCP
   - Task appears on board
   - Agent claims task
   - Status updates reflect in UI
   - Comments added and displayed

2. **Multi-Agent Workflow**
   - Multiple agents query tasks
   - Concurrent task claims
   - Parallel status updates
   - Real-time synchronization

3. **Human Intervention Flow**
   - Monitor identifies stuck task
   - Manual reassignment via UI
   - Agent receives updated assignment
   - Task moves to completion

### 4. Performance Testing

#### Load Testing Scenarios

- [ ] 20 concurrent agents operating
- [ ] 500 active tasks in system
- [ ] 100 tasks per column stress test
- [ ] Rapid task creation (10 tasks/second)
- [ ] Bulk operations (50 tasks at once)

#### Performance Metrics

- API Response Time: < 200ms (p95)
- WebSocket Latency: < 1s (p95)
- UI Render Time: < 100ms
- Database Query Time: < 50ms
- Memory Usage: < 500MB

### 5. WebSocket Testing

#### Real-time Communication Tests

- [ ] Connection establishment
- [ ] Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- [ ] Message broadcasting to all clients
- [ ] Selective updates (board-specific)
- [ ] Large payload handling
- [ ] Connection limit testing (50+ clients)

### 6. UI/UX Testing

#### Visual Testing

- [ ] Responsive design (1024px - 1920px)
- [ ] Color coding accuracy (statistical)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop visual feedback
- [ ] Loading states and spinners
- [ ] Error message display

#### Interaction Testing

- [ ] Drag-and-drop between columns
- [ ] Priority reordering within column
- [ ] Ticket detail modal interaction
- [ ] Form validation and submission
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support

### 7. Error Handling & Recovery

#### Error Scenarios

- [ ] Network disconnection recovery
- [ ] Invalid data submission
- [ ] Concurrent edit conflicts
- [ ] Database connection loss
- [ ] API timeout handling
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection
- [ ] Optimistic update rollback

### 8. Security Testing

#### Basic Security Checks

- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] File upload restrictions
- [ ] Rate limiting verification

## Test Data Requirements

### Initial Test Data

- 3 test boards with different configurations
- 50 test tickets in various states
- 100+ comments across tickets
- 5 simulated agent IDs
- Historical data for statistics

### Test Data Generation Scripts

```python
# Generate test tickets
for i in range(50):
    create_task(
        title=f"Test Task {i}",
        board_id=1,
        priority=f"{i//10}.{i%10}",
        column=random.choice(columns)
    )
```

2. **Concurrent operations** - Data consistency concerns
3. **Performance at scale** - 500 task target
4. **Drag-and-drop reliability** - Core UX feature
5. **MCP-API integration** - Dual access patterns

### Mitigation Strategies

- Extensive WebSocket testing with reconnection scenarios
- Transaction management for concurrent operations
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Cross-browser drag-and-drop testing
- Integration test coverage for all MCP tools

## Next Steps

1. Set up automated test infrastructure
2. Create test data generation scripts
3. Begin Phase 1 execution
4. Document findings in bug tracker
5. Generate test coverage reports
