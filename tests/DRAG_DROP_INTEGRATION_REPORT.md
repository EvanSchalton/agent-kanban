## 🔌 Backend API Integration Analysis

### Current Integration Status

#### Backend Service Health

- **Status:** ✅ Running on port 8000
- **Response:** Server responding to requests
- **API Access:** ⚠️ Method configuration issues detected
- **Endpoints:** 🔍 Need validation for drag-drop operations

#### API Integration Challenges Identified

1. **Method Not Allowed Responses:**

   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/boards
   # Response: {"detail":"Method Not Allowed"}
   ```

   - **Impact:** May indicate endpoint configuration issues
   - **Recommendation:** Verify HTTP method routing

2. **Missing Drag-Drop Specific Endpoints:**
   - **Need:** PATCH/PUT endpoints for card movement
   - **Need:** Column status update API calls
   - **Need:** Position/order update mechanisms

3. **WebSocket Integration:**
   - **Status:** Unknown - needs validation
   - **Need:** Real-time updates for moved cards
   - **Need:** Multi-user synchronization

## 📊 Integration Test Execution Results

### Playwright Test Suite

- **Status:** ⚠️ Test timeout due to webServer configuration
- **Issue:** Browser automation environment setup challenges
- **Resolution:** Created alternative validation approach

### Manual API Validation

- **Backend Accessibility:** ✅ Service responding
- **API Endpoint Access:** ⚠️ Method routing issues
- **Frontend Health:** ✅ Running normally on port 15175
- **Integration Communication:** 🔍 Needs investigation

---

## 🎯 Specific Integration Issues Identified

### 1. API Endpoint Configuration

```javascript
// Expected API patterns for drag-drop:
PATCH /api/tickets/{id}/move
PUT /api/tickets/{id}/column
POST /api/tickets/{id}/position

// Current issue: Method Not Allowed responses
// Indicates potential routing or CORS configuration issues
```

### 2. Frontend-Backend Communication

```javascript
// Need to verify these integration points:
- Card movement triggers API calls
- Column status updates persist to database
- WebSocket notifications for real-time updates
- Error handling for failed API requests
```

### 3. Data Persistence Chain

```
Frontend Drag → API Call → Database Update → WebSocket Broadcast → UI Update
    ✅            ⚠️           🔍              🔍                ✅
  (Working)   (Issues)    (Unknown)       (Unknown)        (Working)
```

## 🔍 Detailed Test Scenario Analysis

### DD-001: TODO → IN PROGRESS Movement

**Test Objective:** Verify card movement with API integration
**Expected:** API calls triggered, database updated, UI synchronized
**Challenge:** API endpoint accessibility for validation

```typescript
// Test implementation created:
await testCard.dragTo(inProgressColumn);
await page.waitForTimeout(3000); // Allow time for API calls

// Monitor API requests during drag operation
const apiRequests = page.apiRequests || [];
const moveApiCalls = apiRequests.filter(req =>
  req.url.includes('move') || req.method === 'PATCH'
);
```

### DD-002: Bidirectional Testing

**Test Objective:** Validate all column movement combinations
**Scenarios:** TODO↔IN PROGRESS↔DONE
**Focus:** API call patterns and data consistency

### DD-003: Backend Persistence

**Test Objective:** Verify moves persist after page refresh
**Method:** Drag operation → Page reload → Verify card position
**Critical:** Database integration validation
