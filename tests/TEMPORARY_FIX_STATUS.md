# üü° TEMPORARY FIX STATUS REPORT

## Current State: Partial Fix Deployed

**Status:** Data corruption prevented, limited functionality
**Impact:** Users can still move cards but with restrictions

## What's Fixed vs What's Not

### ‚úÖ Working (Temporary Fix)

- **Drop ON cards:** Cards can be dropped on other cards to move to that column
- **Data integrity:** Wrong column bug prevented by cancelling risky operations
- **Card-to-card moves:** Full functionality when dropping on existing cards

### ‚ùå Not Working (Cancelled Operations)

- **Drop on empty column space:** Cancelled to prevent wrong column bug
- **Drop on column headers:** Cancelled
- **Drop in empty areas:** Cards return to original position

## Test Coverage Adjusted

### New Test File: `drag-drop-temporary-fix-validation.spec.ts`

Tests verify:

1. ‚úÖ Drops ON cards work correctly
2. ‚úÖ Empty space drops are properly cancelled
3. ‚úÖ Mixed scenarios handled appropriately
4. ‚úÖ Workaround patterns function

## User Workaround Guide

### To Move Cards with Temporary Fix

#### ‚ùå What Won't Work

```
TODO ‚Üí [empty DONE column]  ‚ùå Cancelled
TODO ‚Üí [empty space in IN PROGRESS] ‚ùå Cancelled
```

#### ‚úÖ What Will Work

```
TODO ‚Üí [drop ON card in IN PROGRESS] ‚úÖ Works
TODO ‚Üí [drop ON card in DONE] ‚úÖ Works
```

### Workaround for Empty Columns

Since you can't drop on empty columns directly:

1. First, manually create a card in the target column
2. Then drop other cards ON that card
3. Cards will move to that column

## Test Commands

### Validate Temporary Fix

```bash
# Quick validation (1 minute)
npx playwright test drag-drop-temporary-fix-validation.spec.ts -g "QUICK" --config=playwright-no-server.config.ts

# Full temporary fix tests (3 minutes)
npx playwright test drag-drop-temporary-fix-validation.spec.ts --config=playwright-no-server.config.ts
```

### Expected Results

- ‚úÖ Drop on card tests: PASS
- ‚ùå Drop on empty space tests: FAIL (by design)
- ‚úÖ Cancellation tests: PASS

## Technical Details

### Temporary Fix Implementation

```javascript
// Simplified logic
handleDrop(e) {
  const dropTarget = e.target;

  // TEMPORARY: Only allow drops on cards
  if (!dropTarget.classList.contains('ticket-card')) {
    e.preventDefault();
    return; // Cancel drop
  }

  // Get column from card's parent
  const targetColumn = getCardColumn(dropTarget);
  moveCard(draggedCard, targetColumn);
}
```

### Full Fix Still Needed

```javascript
// FUTURE: Proper column detection
handleDrop(e) {
  const dropTarget = e.target;
  const targetColumn = getColumnFromAnyDropTarget(dropTarget);
  moveCard(draggedCard, targetColumn);
}
```

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience

- **Positive:** No data corruption
- **Negative:** Limited drag & drop functionality
- **Workaround:** Available but not intuitive

### Priority for Full Fix

- **P0:** Still critical - users need full drag & drop
- **Timeline:** Temporary fix buys time for proper solution

## Test Monitoring Plan

### While Temporary Fix is Active

1. **Monitor for regressions:**
   - Run card-on-card drop tests every 10 minutes
   - Verify cancellation still works

2. **Track user issues:**
   - Empty column drop attempts
   - Confusion about limitations
   - Workaround success rate

3. **Ready for full fix:**
   - Original column detection tests ready
   - Can validate immediately when deployed

## Communication

### For PM

- Temporary fix prevents data corruption
- Users have workaround but UX is degraded
- Full fix still needed urgently

### For QA

- Test card-on-card drops thoroughly
- Document any edge cases
- Help users understand workaround

### For Frontend Dev

- Temporary fix is working as designed
- Focus on proper column detection next
- Board.tsx lines 128-131 still need fixing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Validate temporary fix is stable
2. **Short-term:** Document workaround for users
3. **Priority:** Implement full column detection fix
4. **Testing:** Ready to validate full fix immediately
