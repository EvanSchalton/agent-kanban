# Current Status Report - 78% Pass Rate

## 📊 Test Progress

- **Previous:** 83 passing, 21 failing (80%)
- **Current:** 81 passing, 23 failing (78%)
- **Change:** Slight dip but bulk ops improved!

## ✅ Improvements

### Bulk Operations: 8/9 passing (89% success!)

- ✅ Bulk move working (was failing)
- ✅ Bulk assign working (was failing)
- ❌ Performance test still failing

## 🔴 Main Blockers (23 failures)

### 1. History Endpoints - 9 failures (39% of all failures)

**These endpoints exist but return 405:**

- `/api/tickets/{id}/history`
- `/api/boards/{id}/activity`
- `/api/columns/{id}/history`

**Fix:** Add GET handlers to existing routes

### 2. Statistics Endpoints - ~9 failures (39% of all failures)

**Also return 405:**

- `/api/boards/{id}/statistics`
- `/api/tickets/{id}/statistics`

**Fix:** Add GET handlers for statistics

### 3. Other Failures - ~5 failures

- WebSocket connection
- Performance requirements
- Edge cases

## 🎯 Path to 90%+

1. **Fix History Endpoints (Quick Win)**
   - Just need GET handlers added
   - Would fix 9 tests → Jump to 87%

2. **Fix Statistics Endpoints**
   - Add GET handlers for stats
   - Would fix 9 more → Jump to 96%

3. **Final Push**
   - WebSocket configuration
   - Performance optimization
   - Reach 100%!

## Frontend Status

- ✅ Dev server running (port 15174)
- ✅ All UI components ready
- ✅ Integration test dashboard created
- ✅ Waiting for backend endpoints

## Next Steps

The history and statistics endpoints are the key! They exist but just need GET method handlers added. This should be a quick fix that would jump us from 78% to 96%!
