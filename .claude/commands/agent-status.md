## Information Shown

For each agent/window:

- **Session name** - The tmux session identifier
- **Window name** - Descriptive window name
- **Recent activity** - Last 3 lines of meaningful output
- **Current status** - What the agent is working on

## Using the Information

The status report helps you:

1. **Monitor progress** - See what each agent is doing
2. **Identify blockers** - Spot stuck or idle agents
3. **Coordinate work** - Ensure agents aren't duplicating effort
4. **Track commits** - Verify git discipline is maintained

## Filtering Results

The command automatically filters to show only:

- Sessions with "orchestrator" in the name
- Sessions with "corporate-coach" in the name
- Active windows with recent output

## Interpreting Status

### Active Agent Signs

- Recent commands or output
- Working on specific files
- Running tests or builds
- Making commits

### Idle Agent Signs

- No recent activity
- Waiting at prompt
- Repeated status messages
- Error states

## Follow-up Actions

Based on status, you might:

1. **Send instructions** - Use `tmux-message` to guide agents
2. **Check logs** - Review full output with `tmux capture-pane`
3. **Deploy help** - Add PM or QA agents if needed
4. **Schedule check-ins** - Use `/schedule-checkin` for follow-ups

## Advanced Usage

```bash
tmux list-windows -t corporate-coach-frontend
```

### Get Full Window Output

tmux capture-pane -t corporate-coach-frontend:0 -p | less
